    "full_text": "ORIGINAL EPISTLE TO THE READER.\nTAKE Notice, That in this Edition I have made very many Additions to every sheet in the\nbook: and, also, that those books of mine that are printed of that Letter the small Bibles\nare printed with, are very falsely printed: there being twenty or thirty gross mistakes in every\nsheet, many of them such as are exceedingly dangerous to such as shall venture to use them: And\ntherefore I do warn the Public of them: I can do no more at present; only take notice of these\nDirections by which you shall be sure to know the True one from the False.\nThe first Direction.—The true one hath this Title over the head of every Book, The Complete\nHerbal and English Physician enlarged. The small Counterfeit ones have only this\nTitle, The English Physician.\nThe second Direction.—The true one hath these words, Government and Virtues, following\nthe time of the Plants flowering, &c. The counterfeit small ones have these words, Virtues and\nUse, following the time of the Plants flowering.\nThe third Direction.—The true one is of a larger Letter than the counterfeit ones, which are\nin Twelves, &c., of the Letter small Bibles used to be printed on. I shall now speak something\nof the book itself.\nAll other Authors that have written of the nature of Herbs, give not a bit of reason why such\nan Herb was appropriated to such a part of the body, nor why it cured such a disease. Truly my\nown body being sickly, brought me easily into a capacity, to know that health was the greatest of\nall earthly blessings, and truly he was never sick that doth not believe it. Then I considered\nthat all medicines were compounded of Herbs, Roots, Flowers, Seeds, &c., and this first set me\nto work in studying the nature of simples, most of which I knew by sight before; and indeed\nall the Authors I could read gave me but little satisfaction in this particular, or none at all. I\ncannot build my faith upon Authors’ words, nor believe a thing because they say it, and could wish\nevery body were of my mind in this,—to labour to be able to give a reason for every thing they\nsay or do. They say Reason makes a man differ from a Beast; if that be true, pray what are\nthey that, instead of reason for their judgment, quote old Authors? Perhaps their authors knew\na reason for what they wrote, perhaps they did not; what is that to us? Do we know it? Truly\nin writing this work first, to satisfy myself, I drew out all the virtues of the vulgar or common[iv]\nHerbs, Plants, and Trees, &c., out of the best or most approved authors I had, or could get; and\nhaving done so, I set myself to study the reason of them. I knew well enough the whole world,\nand every thing in it, was formed of a composition of contrary elements, and in such a harmony\nas must needs show the wisdom and power of a great God. I knew as well this Creation, though\nthus composed of contraries, was one united body, and man an epitome of it: I knew those\nvarious affections in man, in respect of sickness and health, were caused naturally (though God\nmay have other ends best known to himself) by the various operations of the Microcosm; and I\ncould not be ignorant, that as the cause is, so must the cure be; and therefore he that would\nknow the reason of the operation of the Herbs, must look up as high as the Stars, astrologically.\nI always found the disease vary according to the various motions of the Stars; and this is enough,\none would think, to teach a man by the effect where the cause lies. Then to find out the reason\nof the operation of Herbs, Plants, &c., by the Stars went I; and herein I could find but few\nauthors, but those as full of nonsense and contradiction as an egg is full of meat. This not being\npleasing, and less profitable to me, I consulted with my two brothers, Dr. Reason and Dr.\nExperience, and took a voyage to visit my mother Nature, by whose advice, together with the\nhelp of Dr. Diligence, I at last obtained my desire; and, being warned by Mr. Honesty, a\nstranger in our days, to publish it to the world, I have done it.\nBut you will say, What need I have written on this Subject, seeing so many famous and learned\nmen have written so much of it in the English Tongue, much more than I have done?\nTo this I answer, neither Gerrard nor Parkinson, or any that ever wrote in the like nature,\never gave one wise reason for what they wrote, and so did nothing else but train up young\nnovices in Physic in the School of tradition, and teach them just as a parrot is taught to speak;\nan Author says so, therefore it is true; and if all that Authors say be true, why do they\ncontradict one another? But in mine, if you view it with the eye of reason, you shall see a reason\nfor everything that is written, whereby you may find the very ground and foundation of Physic;\nyou may know what you do, and wherefore you do it; and this shall call me Father, it being\n(that I know of) never done in the world before.\nI have now but two things to write, and then I have done.\n1. What the profit and benefit of this Work is.\n2. Instructions in the use of it.\n1. The profit and benefit arising from it, or that may occur to a wise man from it are many;\nso many that should I sum up all the particulars, my Epistle would be as big as my Book; I shall\nquote some few general heads.\nFirst. The admirable Harmony of the Creation is herein seen, in the influence of Stars upon\nHerbs and the Body of Man, how one part of the Creation is subservient to another, and all\nfor the use of Man, whereby the infinite power and wisdom of God in the creation appear; and\nif I do not admire at the simplicity of the Ranters, never trust me; who but viewing the\nCreation can hold such a sottish opinion, as that it was from eternity, when the mysteries of it\nare so clear to every eye? but that Scripture shall be verified to them, Rom. i. 20: “The invisible\nthings of him from the Creation of the World are clearly seen, being understood by the[v]\nthings that are made, even his Eternal Power and Godhead; so that they are without excuse.”—And\na Poet could teach them a better lesson;\n“Because out of thy thoughts God shall not pass,\n“His image stamped is on every grass.”\nThis indeed is true, God has stamped his image on every creature, and therefore the abuse\nof the creature is a great sin; but how much the more do the wisdom and excellency of God\nappear, if we consider the harmony of the Creation in the virtue and operation of every Herb!\nSecondly, Hereby you may know what infinite knowledge Adam had in his innocence, that\nby looking upon a creature, he was able to give it a name according to its nature; and by knowing\nthat, thou mayest know how great thy fall was and be humbled for it even in this respect,\nbecause hereby thou art so ignorant.\nThirdly, Here is the right way for thee to begin at the study of Physic, if thou art minded\nto begin at the right end, for here thou hast the reason of the whole art. I wrote before in\ncertain Astrological Lectures, which I read, and printed, intituled, Astrological Judgment of\nDiseases, what planet caused (as a second cause) every disease, how it might be found out what\nplanet caused it; here thou hast what planet cures it by Sympathy and Antipathy; and this brings\nme to my last promise, viz.\nInstructions for the right use of the book.\nAnd herein let me premise a word or two. The Herbs, Plants, &c. are now in the book\nappropriated to their proper planets. Therefore,\nFirst, Consider what planet causeth the disease; that thou mayest find it in my aforesaid\nJudgment of Diseases.\nSecondly, Consider what part of the body is afflicted by the disease, and whether it lies in\nthe flesh, or blood, or bones, or ventricles.\nThirdly, Consider by what planet the afflicted part of the body is governed: that my Judgment\nof Diseases will inform you also.\nFourthly, You may oppose diseases by Herbs of the planet, opposite to the planet that causes\nthem: as diseases of Jupiter by herbs of Mercury, and the contrary; diseases of the Luminaries by\nthe herbs of Saturn, and the contrary; diseases of Mars by herbs of Venus, and the contrary.\nFifthly, There is a way to cure diseases sometimes by Sympathy, and so every planet cures\nhis own disease; as the Sun and Moon by their Herbs cure the Eyes, Saturn the Spleen, Jupiter\nthe liver, Mars the Gall and diseases of choler, and Venus diseases in the instruments of Generation.\nNICH. CULPEPER.\nFrom my House in Spitalfields,\nnext door to the Red Lion,\nSeptember 5, 1653.\n[vi]\nTO HIS DEAREST CONSORT\nMRS. ALICE CULPEPER.\nMy dearest,\nTHE works that I have published to the world (though envied by some illiterate physicians)\nhave merited such just applause, that thou mayest be confident in proceeding to publish anything\nI leave thee, especially this master-piece: assuring my friends and countrymen, that they will\nreceive as much benefit by this, as by my Dispensatory, and that incomparable piece called, Semiotica\nUranica enlarged, and English Physician.\nThese are the choicest secrets, which I have had many years locked up in my own breast. I\ngained them by my constant practice, and by them I maintained a continual reputation in the world,\nand I doubt not but the world will honour thee for divulging them; and my fame shall continue\nand increase thereby, though the period of my Life and Studies be at hand, and I must now bid all\nthings under the sun farewell. Farewell, my dear wife and child; farewell, Arts and Sciences, which\nI so dearly loved; farewell, all worldly glories; adieu, readers,\nNicholas Culpeper.\nNicholas Culpeper, the Author of this Work, was son of Nicholas Culpeper, a Clergyman, and\ngrandson of Sir Thomas Culpeper, Bart. He was some time a student in the university of Cambridge,\nand soon after was bound apprentice to an Apothecary. He employed all his leisure hours in the\nstudy of Physic and Astrology, which he afterwards professed, and set up business in Spitalfields,\nnext door to the Red Lion, (formerly known as the Half-way House between Islington and Stepney,\nan exact representation of which we have given under our Author’s Portrait), where he had considerable\npractice, and was much resorted to for his advice, which he gave to the poor gratis. Astrological\nDoctors have always been highly respected; and those celebrated Physicians of the early times,\nwhom our Author seems to have particularly studied, Hippocrates, Galen, and Avicen, regarded\nthose as homicides who were ignorant of Astrology. Paracelsus, indeed, went farther; he declared,\na Physician should be predestinated to the cure of his patient; and the horoscope should be inspected,\nthe plants gathered at the critical moment, &c.\nCulpeper was a writer and translator of several Works, the most celebrated of which is his\nHerbal, “being an astrologo-physical discourse of the common herbs of the nation; containing a\ncomplete Method or Practice of Physic, whereby a Man may preserve his Body in Health, or\ncure himself when sick, with such things only as grow in England, they being most fit for English\nConstitutions.”\nThis celebrated, and useful Physician died at his house in Spitalfields, in the year 1654. This\nBook will remain as a lasting monument of his skill and industry.\n“Culpeper, the man that first ranged the woods and climbed the mountains in search of medicinal and salutary herbs, has\nundoubtedly merited the gratitude of posterity.”— Dr. Johnson.\n[1]\nTHE\nENGLISH PHYSICIAN\n",

Farewell, my dear wife and child; farewell, Arts and Sciences, which\nI so dearly loved; farewell, all worldly glories; adieu, readers,\nNicholas Culpeper.\nNicholas Culpeper, the Author of this Work, was son of Nicholas Culpeper, a Clergyman, and\ngrandson of Sir Thomas Culpeper, Bart. He was some time a student in the university of Cambridge,\nand soon after was bound apprentice to an Apothecary. He employed all his leisure hours in the\nstudy of Physic and Astrology, which he afterwards professed, and set up business in Spitalfields,\nnext door to the Red Lion, (formerly known as the Half-way House between Islington and Stepney,\nan exact representation of which we have given under our Author’s Portrait), where he had considerable\npractice, and was much resorted to for his advice, which he gave to the poor gratis. Astrological\nDoctors have always been highly respected; and those celebrated Physicians of the early times,\nwhom our Author seems to have particularly studied, Hippocrates, Galen, and Avicen, regarded\nthose as homicides who were ignorant of Astrology. Paracelsus, indeed, went farther; he declared,\na Physician should be predestinated to the cure of his patient; and the horoscope should be inspected,\nthe plants gathered at the critical moment, &c.\nCulpeper was a writer and translator of several Works, the most celebrated of which is his\nHerbal, “being an astrologo-physical discourse of the common herbs of the nation; containing a\ncomplete Method or Practice of Physic, whereby a Man may preserve his Body in Health, or\ncure himself when sick, with such things only as grow in England, they being most fit for English\nConstitutions.”\nThis celebrated, and useful Physician died at his house in Spitalfields, in the year 1654. This\nBook will remain as a lasting monument of his skill and industry.\n“Culpeper, the man that first ranged the woods and climbed the mountains in search of medicinal and salutary herbs, has\nundoubtedly merited the gratitude of posterity.”— Dr. Johnson.\n[1]\nTHE\nENGLISH PHYSICIAN"

It helps old ulcers, hot inflammations,\nburnings by common fire, and St.\nAnthony’s fire, by antipathy to Mars; for\nthese uses, your best way is to make it into\nan ointment; also, if you make a vinegar\nof it, as you make vinegar of roses, it helps\nthe morphew and leprosy; if you apply the\nherb to the privities, it draws forth the dead\nchild. It helps the yellow jaundice, spleen,\nand gravel in the kidneys. Dioscorides\nsaith it helps such as are bitten by a venomous\nbeast, whether it be taken inwardly,\nor applied to the wound; nay, he saith further,\nif any one that hath newly eaten it,\ndo but spit into the mouth of a serpent, the\nserpent instantly dies. It stays the flux of\nthe belly, kills worms, helps the fits of the\nmother. Its decoction made in wine, and\ndrank, strengthens the back, and eases the\npains thereof: It helps bruises and falls,\nand is as gallant a remedy to drive out the\nsmall pox and measles as any is; an ointment\nmade of it, is excellent for green\nwounds, pricks or thrusts.\nADDER’S TONGUE OR SERPENT’S TONGUE.\nDescript.] This herb has but one leaf,\nwhich grows with the stalk a finger’s length\nabove the ground, being flat and of a fresh\ngreen colour; broad like Water Plantain,\nbut less, without any rib in it; from the\nbottom of which leaf, on the inside, rises\nup (ordinarily) one, sometimes two or\nthree slender stalks, the upper half whereof\nis somewhat bigger, and dented with small\ndents of a yellowish green colour, like the\ntongue of an adder serpent (only this is as\nuseful as they are formidable). The roots\ncontinue all the year.\nPlace.] It grows in moist meadows, and\nsuch like places.\nTime.] It is to be found in May or April,\nfor it quickly perishes with a little heat.\nGovernment and virtues.] It is an herb\nunder the dominion of the Moon and Cancer,\nand therefore if the weakness of the\nretentive faculty be caused by an evil influence\nof Saturn in any part of the body\ngoverned by the Moon, or under the dominion\nof Cancer, this herb cures it by sympathy:\nIt cures these diseases after specified,\nin any part of the body under the influence\nof Saturn, by antipathy.\nIt is temperate in respect of heat, but\ndry in the second degree. The juice of the\nleaves, drank with the distilled water of\nHorse-tail, is a singular remedy for all manner\nof wounds in the breast, bowels, or\nother parts of the body, and is given with\ngood success to those that are troubled\nwith casting, vomiting, or bleeding at the\nmouth or nose, or otherwise downwards.\nThe said juice given in the distilled water\nof Oaken-buds, is very good for women who[4]\nhave their usual courses, or the whites flowing\ndown too abundantly. It helps sore eyes.\nOf the leaves infused or boiled in oil, omphacine\nor unripe olives, set in the sun four\ncertain days, or the green leaves sufficiently\nboiled in the said oil, is made an excellent\ngreen balsam, not only for green and fresh\nwounds, but also for old and inveterate ulcers,\nespecially if a little fine clear turpentine\nbe dissolved therein.

The root is small with\nstrings.\nPlace.] It is commonly found under\nhedges, and on the sides of ditches, under\nhouses, or in shadowed lanes, and other\nwaste grounds, in almost every part of this\nland.\nTime.] They flower somewhat early, and\nabide a great while; the leaves continue\ngreen until Winter, and sometimes abide,\nexcept the Winter be very sharp and cold.\nGovernment and virtues.] It is an herb of\nVenus, and therefore cures the diseases she\ncauses by sympathy, and those of Mars by\nantipathy; you may usually find it all the\nyear long except the year be extremely\nfrosty; it is quick, sharp, and bitter in taste,\nand is thereby found to be hot and dry; a\nsingular herb for all inward wounds, exulcerated\nlungs, or other parts, either by itself,\nor boiled with other the like herbs; and\nbeing drank, in a short time it eases all\ngriping pains, windy and choleric humours\nin the stomach, spleen or belly; helps the\nyellow jaundice, by opening the stoppings\nof the gall and liver, and melancholy, by\nopening the stoppings of the spleen; expels\nvenom or poison, and also the plague;\nit provokes urine and women’s courses; the\ndecoction of it in wine drank for some time\ntogether, procures ease to them that are\ntroubled with the sciatica, or hip-gout: as\nalso the gout in hands, knees or feet; if\nyou put to the decoction some honey and\na little burnt alum, it is excellently good to\ngargle any sore mouth or throat, and to\nwash the sores and ulcers in the privy parts\nof man or woman; it speedily helps green\nwounds, being bruised and bound thereto.\nThe juice of it boiled with a little honey\nand verdigrease, doth wonderfully cleanse\nfistulas, ulcers, and stays the spreading or\neating of cancers and ulcers; it helps the\nitch, scabs, wheals, and other breakings\nout in any part of the body. The juice of\nCelandine, Field-daisies, and Ground-ivy\nclarified, and a little fine sugar dissolved\ntherein, and dropped into the eyes, is a\nsovereign remedy for all pains, redness, and\nwatering of them; as also for the pin and\nweb, skins and films growing over the sight,\nit helps beasts as well as men. The juice\ndropped into the ears, wonderfully helps\nthe noise and singing of them, and helps the\nhearing which is decayed. It is good to\ntun up with new drink, for it will clarify it\nin a night, that it will be the fitter to be\ndrank the next morning; or if any drink\nbe thick with removing, or any other accident,\nit will do the like in a few hours."

In all epidemical diseases\ncaused by Saturn, that is as good a preservative\nas grows: It resists poison, by defending\nand comforting the heart, blood,\nand spirits; it doth the like against the\nplague and all epidemical diseases, if the\nroot be taken in powder to the weight of\nhalf a dram at a time, with some good treacle\nin Carduus water, and the party thereupon\nlaid to sweat in his bed; if treacle be\nnot to be had take it alone in Carduus or\nAngelica-water. The stalks or roots candied\nand eaten fasting, are good preservatives\nin time of infection; and at other\ntimes to warm and comfort a cold stomach.\nThe root also steeped in vinegar, and a little\nof that vinegar taken sometimes fasting, and[9]\nthe root smelled unto, is good for the same\npurpose. A water distilled from the root\nsimply, as steeped in wine, and distilled in\na glass, is much more effectual than the\nwater of the leaves; and this water, drank\ntwo or three spoonfuls at a time, easeth all\npains and torments coming of cold and\nwind, so that the body be not bound; and\ntaken with some of the root in powder at\nthe beginning, helpeth the pleurisy, as also\nall other diseases of the lungs and breast,\nas coughs, phthysic, and shortness of breath;\nand a syrup of the stalks do the like. It\nhelps pains of the cholic, the stranguary and\nstoppage of the urine, procureth womens’\ncourses, and expelleth the after-birth, openeth\nthe stoppings of the liver and spleen,\nand briefly easeth and discusseth all windiness\nand inward swellings. The decoction\ndrank before the fit of an ague, that they\nmay sweat (if possible) before the fit comes,\nwill, in two or three times taking, rid it\nquite away; it helps digestion and is a remedy\nfor a surfeit. The juice or the water,\nbeing dropped into the eyes or ears, helps\ndimness of sight and deafness; the juice\nput into the hollow teeth, easeth their pains.\nThe root in powder, made up into a plaster\nwith a little pitch, and laid on the biting of\nmad dogs, or any other venomous creature,\ndoth wonderfully help. The juice or the\nwaters dropped, or tent wet therein, and put\ninto filthy dead ulcers, or the powder of the\nroot (in want of either) doth cleanse and\ncause them to heal quickly, by covering the\nnaked bones with flesh; the distilled water\napplied to places pained with the gout, or\nsciatica, doth give a great deal of ease.\nThe wild Angelica is not so effectual as\nthe garden; although it may be safely used\nto all the purposes aforesaid."

At the joints,\nwith the leaves, stand larger and more open\ngaping white flowers, husks round about\nthe stalks, but not with such a bush of leaves\nas flowers set in the top, as is on the other,\nwherein stand small roundish black seeds:\nthe root is white, with many strings at it,\nnot growing downward but lying under the\nupper crust of the earth, and abides many\nyears increasing; this has not so strong a\nscent as the former.\nYellow Archangel is like the White in\nthe stalks and leaves; but that the stalks\nare more straight and upright, and the joints\nwith leaves are farther asunder, having longer\nleaves than the former, and the flowers\na little larger and more gaping, of a fair\nyellow colour in most, in some paler. The\nroots are like the white, only they creep not\nso much under the ground.\nPlace.] They grow almost every where\n(unless it be in the middle of the street), the\nyellow most usually in the wet grounds of\nwoods, and sometimes in the dryer, in divers\ncounties of this nation.\nTime.] They flower from the beginning\nof the Spring all the Summer long.\nGovernment and virtues.] The Archangels\nare somewhat hot and drier than the stinging\nNettles, and used with better success\nfor the stopping and hardness of the spleen,\nthan they, by using the decoction of the\nherb in wine, and afterwards applying the\nherb hot into the region of the spleen as a\nplaister, or the decoction with spunges.\nFlowers of the White Archangel are preserved\nor conserved to be used to stay the\nwhites, and the flowers of the red to stay\nthe reds in women. It makes the heart\nmerry, drives away melancholy, quickens[12]\nthe spirits, is good against quartan agues,\nstancheth bleeding at mouth and nose, if it\nbe stamped and applied to the nape of the\nneck; the herb also bruised, and with some\nsalt and vinegar and hog’s-grease, laid upon\na hard tumour or swelling, or that vulgarly\ncalled the king’s evil, do help to dissolve or\ndiscuss them; and being in like manner\napplied, doth much allay the pains, and give\nease to the gout, sciatica, and other pains\nof the joints and sinews. It is also very\neffectual to heal green wounds, and old\nulcers; also to stay their fretting, gnawing,\nand spreading. It draws forth splinters,\nand such like things gotten into the flesh,\nand is very good against bruises and burnings.\nBut the Yellow Archangel is most\ncommended for old, filthy, corrupt sores\nand ulcers, yea although they grow to be\nhollow, and to dissolve tumours. The\nchief use of them is for women, it being a\nherb of Venus."

The powder mixed with\npure honey is no less available for all sorts\nof coughs or colds, wheesing, or shortness\nof breath, distillations of thin rheum upon\nthe lungs, which causes consumptions.\nThe decoction made with Mead, and a little\nPennyroyal, is good for those that are\ntroubled with putrid agues, whether quotidian,\ntertian, or quartan, and to draw\ndown and evacuate the blood and humours,\nthat by falling into the eyes, do hinder the\nsight; the decoction thereof made in wine\nand taken, kills the worms in the belly,\nopens obstructions both of the spleen and\nliver; cures stitches, and pains in the\nback and sides, the torments and griping\npains in the bowels, and the wind cholic;\nand mixed with honey purges the belly,\nhelps to bring down women’s courses, and\nis of special use for those that are troubled\nwith the falling down of the mother, and\npains thereof, and causes an easy and\nspeedy delivery of women in child-birth.\nIt helps also to break and expel the stone,\neither in the bladder or kidneys. The decoction\nwith wine gargled in the mouth,\neases the tooth-ache. It is commended\nagainst the stinging and biting of venomous\nserpents, or mad dogs, being used inwardly\nand applied outwardly to the place. A\ndram of the powder of Betony taken with\na little honey in some vinegar, does wonderfully\nrefresh those that are over wearied\nby travelling. It stays bleeding at the mouth\nor nose, and helps those that void or spit\nblood, and those that are bursten or have\na rupture, and is good for such as are\nbruised by any fall or otherwise. The\ngreen herb bruised, or the juice applied to\nany inward hurt, or outward green wound\nin the head or body, will quickly heal and\nclose it up; as also any vein or sinews that\nare cut, and will draw forth any broken\nbone or splinter, thorn or other things got\ninto the flesh. It is no less profitable for\nold sores or filthy ulcers, yea, tho’ they be\nfistulous and hollow. But some do advise[23]\nto put a little salt for this purpose, being\napplied with a little hog’s lard, it helps a\nplague sore, and other boils and pushes.\nThe fumes of the decoction while it is\nwarm, received by a funnel into the ears,\neases the pains of them, destroys the worms\nand cures the running sores in them. The\njuice dropped into them does the same.\nThe root of Betony is displeasing both to\nthe taste and stomach, whereas the leaves\nand flowers, by their sweet and spicy\ntaste, are comfortable both to meat and\nmedicine.\nThese are some of the many virtues\nAnthony Muse, an expert physician (for\nit was not the practice of Octavius Cæsar\nto keep fools about him), appropriates to\nBetony; it is a very precious herb, that is\ncertain, and most fitting to be kept in a\nman’s house, both in syrup, conserve, oil,\nointment and plaister.

The narrow\nleafed Bistort grows in the north, in\nLancashire, Yorkshire, and Cumberland.\nTime.] They flower about the end of\nMay, and the seed is ripe about the beginning\nof July.\nGovernment and virtues.] It belongs to\nSaturn, and is in operation cold and dry;\nboth the leaves and roots have a powerful\nfaculty to resist all poison. The root, in\npowder, taken in drink expels the venom of\nthe plague, the small-pox, measels, purples,\nor any other infectious disease, driving\nit out by sweating. The root in powder,\nthe decoction thereof in wine being drank,\nstays all manner of inward bleeding, or\nspitting of blood, and any fluxes in the\nbody of either man or woman, or vomiting.\nIt is also very available against ruptures,\nor burstings, or all bruises from falls, dissolving\nthe congealed blood, and easing the\npains that happen thereupon; it also helps\nthe jaundice.\nThe water, distilled from both leaves and\nroots, is a singular remedy to wash any\nplace bitten or stung by any venomous\ncreature; as also for any of the purposes\nbefore spoken of, and is very good to wash\nany running sores or ulcers. The decoction\nof the root in wine being drank, hinders\nabortion or miscarriage in child-bearing.\nThe leaves also kill the worms in children,\nand is a great help to them that cannot keep\ntheir water; if the juice of Plaintain be\nadded thereto, and outwardly applied, much\nhelps the ghonorrhea, or running of the\nreins. A dram of the powder of the root,\ntaken in water thereof, wherein some red\nhot iron or steel hath been quenched, is also\nan admirable help thereto, so as the body\nbe first prepared and purged from the offensive\nhumours. The leaves, seed, or roots,\nare all very good in decoction, drinks, or\nlotions, for inward or outward wounds, or\nother sores. And the powder, strewed upon\nany cut or wound in a vein, stays the\nimmoderate bleeding thereof.

    "government_virtues": "It is an excellent\nplant under the dominion of the Moon;\nI could wish such as are studious would\nlabour to keep it in their gardens. The\nleaves being boiled and used in clysters, is\nexcellent good to mollify the belly, and\nmake the passage slippery. The decoction\ndrank inwardly, is excellent and good for\nthe bloody-flux; The leaves being bruised,[30]\nor rather boiled and applied like a poultice\nare excellent good to unite broken bones\nand strengthen joints that have been put\nout. The decoction of either leaves or\nroots being drank, and the decoction of\nleaves applied to the place, is excellent\ngood for the king’s evil that is broken and\nruns; for by the influence of the moon,\nit revives the ends of the veins which are\nrelaxed. There is scarce a better remedy to\nbe applied to such places as are burnt with\nfire than this is, for it fetches out the fire,\nand heals it without a scar. This is an\nexcellent remedy for such as are bursten,\nbeing either taken inwardly, or applied to\nthe place. In like manner used, it helps\nthe cramp and the gout. It is excellently\ngood in hectic fevers, and restores radical\nmoisture to such as are in consumptions.\nBRIONY, OR WILD VINE.\nIt is called Wild, and Wood Vine, Tamus,\nor Ladies’ Seal. The white is called White\nVine by some; and the black, Black Vine.\nDescript.] The common White Briony\ngrows ramping upon the hedges, sending\nforth many long, rough, very tender\nbranches at the beginning, with many very\nrough, and broad leaves thereon, cut (for\nthe most part) into five partitions, in form\nvery like a vine leaf, but smaller, rough, and\nof a whitish hoary green colour, spreading\nvery far, spreading and twining with his\nsmall claspers (that come forth at the joints\nwith the leaves) very far on whatsoever\nstands next to it. At the several joints\nalso (especially towards the top of the\nbranches) comes forth a long stalk bearing\nmany whitish flowers together on a long\ntuft, consisting of five small leaves a-piece,\nlaid open like a star, after which come the\nberries separated one from another, more\nthan a cluster of grapes, green at the first,\nand very red when they are thorough ripe,\nof no good scent, but of a most loathsome\ntaste provokes vomit. The root grows to\nbe exceeding great, with many long twines\nor branches going from it, of a pale whitish\ncolour on the outside, and more white\nwithin, and of a sharp, bitter, loathsome\ntaste.\nPlace.] It grows on banks, or under\nhedges, through this land; the roots lie\nvery deep.\nTime.] It flowers in July and August,\nsome earlier, and some later than the other.\nGovernment and virtues.] They are furious\nmartial plants. The root of Briony purges\nthe belly with great violence, troubling the\nstomach and burning the liver, and therefore\nnot rashly to be taken; but being corrected,\nis very profitable for the diseases\nof the head, as falling sickness, giddiness,\nand swimmings, by drawing away much\nphlegm and rheumatic humours that oppress\nthe head, as also the joints and\nsinews; and is therefore good for palsies,\nconvulsions, cramps, and stitches in the\nsides, and the dropsy, and for provoking\nurine; it cleanses the reins and kidneys\nfrom gravel and stone, by opening the obstructions\nof the spleen, and consume the\nhardness and swelling thereof. The decoction\nof the root in wine, drank once a\nweek at going to bed, cleanses the mother,\nand helps the rising thereof, expels the\ndead child; a dram of the root in powder\ntaken in white wine, brings down their\ncourses. An electuary made of the roots\nand honey, doth mightily cleanse the chest\nof rotten phlegm, and wonderfully help\nany old strong cough, to those that are\ntroubled with shortness of breath, and is\ngood for them that are bruised inwardly, to\nhelp to expel the clotted or congealed blood.\nThe leaves, fruit, and root do cleanse old\nand filthy sores, are good against all fretting\nand running cankers, gangrenes, and\ntetters and therefore the berries are by\nsome country people called tetter-berries.\nThe root cleanses the skin wonderfully\nfrom all black and blue spots, freckles,[31]\nmorphew, leprosy, foul scars, or other deformity\nwhatsoever; also all running scabs\nand manginess are healed by the powder of\nthe dried root, or the juice thereof, but\nespecially by the fine white hardened juice.\nThe distilled water of the root works the\nsame effects, but more weakly; the root\nbruised and applied of itself to any place\nwhere the bones are broken, helps to draw\nthem forth, as also splinters and thorns in\nthe flesh; and being applied with a little\nwine mixed therewith, it breaks boils, and\nhelps whitlows on the joints.—For all these\nlatter, beginning at sores, cancers, &c.\napply it outwardly, mixing it with a little\nhog’s grease, or other convenient ointment.\nAs for the former diseases where it must\nbe taken inwardly, it purges very violently,\nand needs an abler hand to correct it than\nmost country people have.\nBROOK LIME, OR WATER-PIMPERNEL.\nDescript.] This sends forth from a\ncreeping root that shoots forth strings at\nevery joint, as it runs, divers and sundry\ngreen stalks, round and sappy with some\nbranches on them, somewhat broad, round,\ndeep green, and thick leaves set by couples\nthereon; from the bottom whereof shoot\nforth long foot stalks, with sundry small\nblue flowers on them, that consist of five\nsmall round pointed leaves a piece.\nThere is another sort nothing different\nfrom the former, but that it is greater, and\nthe flowers of a paler green colour.\nPlace.] They grow in small standing\nwaters, and usually near Water-Cresses.\nTime.] And flower in June and July,\ngiving seed the next month after.\nGovernment and virtues.] It is a hot and\nbiting martial plant. Brook-lime and\nWater-Cresses are generally used together\nin diet-drink, with other things serving to\npurge the blood and body from all ill\nhumours that would destroy health, and\nare helpful to the scurvy. They do all\nprovoke urine, and help to break the stone,\nand pass it away; they procure women’s\ncourses, and expel the dead child. Being\nfried with butter and vinegar, and applied\nwarm, it helps all manner of tumours, swellings,\nand inflammations.\nSuch drinks ought to be made of sundry\nherbs, according to the malady. I shall\ngive a plain and easy rule at the latter end\nof this book.\nBUTCHER’S BROOM.\nIt is called Ruscus, and Bruscus, Kneeholm,\nKneeholly, Kneehulver, and Pettigree.\nDescript.] The first shoots that sprout\nfrom the root of Butcher’s Broom, are\nthick, whitish, and short, somewhat like\nthose of Asparagus, but greater, they rise\nup to be a foot and half high, are spread\ninto divers branches, green, and somewhat\ncreased with the roundness, tough and flexible,\nwhereon are set somewhat broad and\nalmost round hard leaves and prickly,\npointed at the end, of a dark green colour,\ntwo at the most part set at a place, very\nclose and near together; about the middle\nof the leaf, on the back and lower side\nfrom the middle rib, breaks forth a small\nwhitish green flower, consisting of four\nsmall round pointed leaves, standing upon\nlittle or no footstalk, and in the place\nwhereof comes a small round berry, green\nat the first, and red when it is ripe, wherein\nare two or three white, hard, round seeds\ncontained. The root is thick, white and\ngreat at the head, and from thence sends\nforth divers thick, white, long, tough strings.\nPlace.] It grows in copses, and upon\nheaths and waste grounds, and oftentimes\nunder or near the holly bushes.\nTime.] It shoots forth its young buds\nin the Spring, and the berries are ripe\nabout September, the branches of leaves\nabiding green all the Winter.\nGovernment and virtues.] It is a plant of[32]\nMars, being of a gallant cleansing and\nopening quality. The decoction of the\nroot made with wine opens obstructions,\nprovokes urine, helps to expel gravel and\nthe stone, the stranguary and women’s\ncourses, also the yellow jaundice and the\nhead-ache; and with same honey or sugar\nput thereunto, cleanses the breast of phlegm,\nand the chest of such clammy humours\ngathered therein. The decoction of the\nroot drank, and a poultice made of the\nberries and leaves applied, are effectual in\nknitting and consolidating broken bones or\nparts out of joint. The common way of\nusing it, is to boil the root of it, and Parsley\nand Fennel and Smallage in white wine, and\ndrink the decoction, adding the like quantity\nof Grass-root to them: The more of\nthe root you boil, the stronger will the decoction\nbe; it works no ill effects, yet I\nhope you have wit enough to give the\nstrongest decoction to the strongest bodies.\nBROOM, AND BROOM-RAPE.\nTo spend time in writing a description\nhereof is altogether needless, it being so\ngenerally used by all the good housewives\nalmost through this land to sweep their\nhouses with, and therefore very well known\nto all sorts of people.\nThe Broom-rape springs up in many\nplaces from the roots of the broom (but\nmore often in fields, as by hedge-sides and\non heaths). The stalk whereof is of the\nbigness of a finger or thumb, above two\nfeet high, having a shew of leaves on them,\nand many flowers at the top, of a reddish\nyellow colour, as also the stalks and leaves\nare.\nPlace.] They grow in many places of\nthis land commonly, and as commonly\nspoil all the land they grow in.\nTime.] They flower in the Summer\nmonths, and give their seed before Winter.\nGovernment and virtues.] The juice or\ndecoction of the young branches, or seed,\nor the powder of the seed taken in drink\npurges downwards, and draws phlegmatic\nand watery humours from the joints; whereby\nit helps the dropsy, gout, sciatica, and\npains of the hips and joints; it also provokes\nstrong vomits, and helps the pains of\nthe sides, and swelling of the spleen,\ncleanses also the reins or kidneys and bladder\nof the stone, provokes urine abundantly,\nand hinders the growing again of the stone\nin the body. The continual use of the\npowder of the leaves and seed doth cure\nthe black jaundice. The distilled water of\nthe flowers is profitable for all the same\npurposes: it also helps surfeit, and alters\nthe fit of agues, if three or four ounces\nthereof, with as much of the water of the\nlesser Centaury, and a little sugar put therein,\nbe taken a little before the fit comes,\nand the party be laid down to sweat in his\nbed. The oil or water that is drawn from\nthe end of the green sticks heated in the\nfire, helps the tooth-ache. The juice of\nyoung branches made into an ointment of\nold hog’s grease, and anointed, or the young\nbranches bruised and heated in oil or hog’s\ngrease, and laid to the sides pained by\nwind, as in stitches, or the spleen, ease\nthem in once or twice using it. The same\nboiled in oil is the safest and surest medicine\nto kill lice in the head or body of any;\nand is an especial remedy for joint aches,\nand swollen knees, that come by the falling\ndown of humours.\nThe BROOM RAPE also is not without its virtues.\nThe decoction thereof in wine, is thought\nto be as effectual to void the stone in the\nkidney or bladder, and to provoke urine,\nas the Broom itself. The juice thereof is\na singular good help to cure as well green\nwounds, as old and filthy sores and malignant\nulcers. The insolate oil, wherein there\nhas been three or four repetitions of infusion\nof the top stalks, with flowers strained and[33]\ncleared, cleanses the skin from all manner\nof spots, marks, and freckles that rise either\nby the heat of the sun, or the malignity of\nhumours. As for the Broom and Broom-rape,\nMars owns them, and is exceeding\nprejudicial to the liver, I suppose by reason\nof the antipathy between Jupiter and Mars;\ntherefore if the liver be disaffected, minister\nnone of it.\nBUCK’S-HORN PLANTAIN.\nDescript.] This being sown of seed,\nrises up at first with small, long, narrow,\nhairy, dark green leaves like grass, without\nany division or gash in them, but those that\nfollow are gashed in on both sides the\nleaves into three or four gashes, and pointed\nat the ends, resembling the knags of a\nbuck’s horn (whereof it took its name), and\nbeing well wound round about the root\nupon the ground, in order one by another,\nthereby resembling the form of a star, from\namong which rise up divers hairy stalks,\nabout a hand’s breadth high, bearing every\none a small, long spiky head, like to those\nof the common Plantain having such like\nbloomings and seed after them.

The decoction\ndrank inwardly, is excellent and good for\nthe bloody-flux; The leaves being bruised,[30]\nor rather boiled and applied like a poultice\nare excellent good to unite broken bones\nand strengthen joints that have been put\nout. The decoction of either leaves or\nroots being drank, and the decoction of\nleaves applied to the place, is excellent\ngood for the king’s evil that is broken and\nruns; for by the influence of the moon,\nit revives the ends of the veins which are\nrelaxed. There is scarce a better remedy to\nbe applied to such places as are burnt with\nfire than this is, for it fetches out the fire,\nand heals it without a scar. This is an\nexcellent remedy for such as are bursten,\nbeing either taken inwardly, or applied to\nthe place. In like manner used, it helps\nthe cramp and the gout. It is excellently\ngood in hectic fevers, and restores radical\nmoisture to such as are in consumptions.\nBRIONY, OR WILD VINE.\nIt is called Wild, and Wood Vine, Tamus,\nor Ladies’ Seal. The white is called White\nVine by some; and the black, Black Vine.\nDescript.] The common White Briony\ngrows ramping upon the hedges, sending\nforth many long, rough, very tender\nbranches at the beginning, with many very\nrough, and broad leaves thereon, cut (for\nthe most part) into five partitions, in form\nvery like a vine leaf, but smaller, rough, and\nof a whitish hoary green colour, spreading\nvery far, spreading and twining with his\nsmall claspers (that come forth at the joints\nwith the leaves) very far on whatsoever\nstands next to it. At the several joints\nalso (especially towards the top of the\nbranches) comes forth a long stalk bearing\nmany whitish flowers together on a long\ntuft, consisting of five small leaves a-piece,\nlaid open like a star, after which come the\nberries separated one from another, more\nthan a cluster of grapes, green at the first,\nand very red when they are thorough ripe,\nof no good scent, but of a most loathsome\ntaste provokes vomit. The root grows to\nbe exceeding great, with many long twines\nor branches going from it, of a pale whitish\ncolour on the outside, and more white\nwithin, and of a sharp, bitter, loathsome\ntaste.\nPlace.] It grows on banks, or under\nhedges, through this land; the roots lie\nvery deep.\nTime.] It flowers in July and August,\nsome earlier, and some later than the other.\nGovernment and virtues.] They are furious\nmartial plants. The root of Briony purges\nthe belly with great violence, troubling the\nstomach and burning the liver, and therefore\nnot rashly to be taken; but being corrected,\nis very profitable for the diseases\nof the head, as falling sickness, giddiness,\nand swimmings, by drawing away much\nphlegm and rheumatic humours that oppress\nthe head, as also the joints and\nsinews; and is therefore good for palsies,\nconvulsions, cramps, and stitches in the\nsides, and the dropsy, and for provoking\nurine; it cleanses the reins and kidneys\nfrom gravel and stone, by opening the obstructions\nof the spleen, and consume the\nhardness and swelling thereof. The decoction\nof the root in wine, drank once a\nweek at going to bed, cleanses the mother,\nand helps the rising thereof, expels the\ndead child; a dram of the root in powder\ntaken in white wine, brings down their\ncourses. An electuary made of the roots\nand honey, doth mightily cleanse the chest\nof rotten phlegm, and wonderfully help\nany old strong cough, to those that are\ntroubled with shortness of breath, and is\ngood for them that are bruised inwardly, to\nhelp to expel the clotted or congealed blood.\nThe leaves, fruit, and root do cleanse old\nand filthy sores, are good against all fretting\nand running cankers, gangrenes, and\ntetters and therefore the berries are by\nsome country people called tetter-berries.\nThe root cleanses the skin wonderfully\nfrom all black and blue spots, freckles,[31]\nmorphew, leprosy, foul scars, or other deformity\nwhatsoever; also all running scabs\nand manginess are healed by the powder of\nthe dried root, or the juice thereof, but\nespecially by the fine white hardened juice.\nThe distilled water of the root works the\nsame effects, but more weakly; the root\nbruised and applied of itself to any place\nwhere the bones are broken, helps to draw\nthem forth, as also splinters and thorns in\nthe flesh; and being applied with a little\nwine mixed therewith, it breaks boils, and\nhelps whitlows on the joints.—For all these\nlatter, beginning at sores, cancers, &c.\napply it outwardly, mixing it with a little\nhog’s grease, or other convenient ointment.\nAs for the former diseases where it must\nbe taken inwardly, it purges very violently,\nand needs an abler hand to correct it than\nmost country people have.\nBROOK LIME, OR WATER-PIMPERNEL.\nDescript.] This sends forth from a\ncreeping root that shoots forth strings at\nevery joint, as it runs, divers and sundry\ngreen stalks, round and sappy with some\nbranches on them, somewhat broad, round,\ndeep green, and thick leaves set by couples\nthereon; from the bottom whereof shoot\nforth long foot stalks, with sundry small\nblue flowers on them, that consist of five\nsmall round pointed leaves a piece.\nThere is another sort nothing different\nfrom the former, but that it is greater, and\nthe flowers of a paler green colour.\nPlace.] They grow in small standing\nwaters, and usually near Water-Cresses.\nTime.] And flower in June and July,\ngiving seed the next month after.\nGovernment and virtues.] It is a hot and\nbiting martial plant. Brook-lime and\nWater-Cresses are generally used together\nin diet-drink, with other things serving to\npurge the blood and body from all ill\nhumours that would destroy health, and\nare helpful to the scurvy. They do all\nprovoke urine, and help to break the stone,\nand pass it away; they procure women’s\ncourses, and expel the dead child. Being\nfried with butter and vinegar, and applied\nwarm, it helps all manner of tumours, swellings,\nand inflammations.\nSuch drinks ought to be made of sundry\nherbs, according to the malady. I shall\ngive a plain and easy rule at the latter end\nof this book.\nBUTCHER’S BROOM.\nIt is called Ruscus, and Bruscus, Kneeholm,\nKneeholly, Kneehulver, and Pettigree.\nDescript.] The first shoots that sprout\nfrom the root of Butcher’s Broom, are\nthick, whitish, and short, somewhat like\nthose of Asparagus, but greater, they rise\nup to be a foot and half high, are spread\ninto divers branches, green, and somewhat\ncreased with the roundness, tough and flexible,\nwhereon are set somewhat broad and\nalmost round hard leaves and prickly,\npointed at the end, of a dark green colour,\ntwo at the most part set at a place, very\nclose and near together; about the middle\nof the leaf, on the back and lower side\nfrom the middle rib, breaks forth a small\nwhitish green flower, consisting of four\nsmall round pointed leaves, standing upon\nlittle or no footstalk, and in the place\nwhereof comes a small round berry, green\nat the first, and red when it is ripe, wherein\nare two or three white, hard, round seeds\ncontained. The root is thick, white and\ngreat at the head, and from thence sends\nforth divers thick, white, long, tough strings.\nPlace.] It grows in copses, and upon\nheaths and waste grounds, and oftentimes\nunder or near the holly bushes.\nTime.] It shoots forth its young buds\nin the Spring, and the berries are ripe\nabout September, the branches of leaves\nabiding green all the Winter.\nGovernment and virtues.] It is a plant of[32]\nMars, being of a gallant cleansing and\nopening quality. The decoction of the\nroot made with wine opens obstructions,\nprovokes urine, helps to expel gravel and\nthe stone, the stranguary and women’s\ncourses, also the yellow jaundice and the\nhead-ache; and with same honey or sugar\nput thereunto, cleanses the breast of phlegm,\nand the chest of such clammy humours\ngathered therein. The decoction of the\nroot drank, and a poultice made of the\nberries and leaves applied, are effectual in\nknitting and consolidating broken bones or\nparts out of joint. The common way of\nusing it, is to boil the root of it, and Parsley\nand Fennel and Smallage in white wine, and\ndrink the decoction, adding the like quantity\nof Grass-root to them: The more of\nthe root you boil, the stronger will the decoction\nbe; it works no ill effects, yet I\nhope you have wit enough to give the\nstrongest decoction to the strongest bodies.\nBROOM, AND BROOM-RAPE.\nTo spend time in writing a description\nhereof is altogether needless, it being so\ngenerally used by all the good housewives\nalmost through this land to sweep their\nhouses with, and therefore very well known\nto all sorts of people.\nThe Broom-rape springs up in many\nplaces from the roots of the broom (but\nmore often in fields, as by hedge-sides and\non heaths). The stalk whereof is of the\nbigness of a finger or thumb, above two\nfeet high, having a shew of leaves on them,\nand many flowers at the top, of a reddish\nyellow colour, as also the stalks and leaves\nare.\nPlace.] They grow in many places of\nthis land commonly, and as commonly\nspoil all the land they grow in.\nTime.] They flower in the Summer\nmonths, and give their seed before Winter.\nGovernment and virtues.] The juice or\ndecoction of the young branches, or seed,\nor the powder of the seed taken in drink\npurges downwards, and draws phlegmatic\nand watery humours from the joints; whereby\nit helps the dropsy, gout, sciatica, and\npains of the hips and joints; it also provokes\nstrong vomits, and helps the pains of\nthe sides, and swelling of the spleen,\ncleanses also the reins or kidneys and bladder\nof the stone, provokes urine abundantly,\nand hinders the growing again of the stone\nin the body. The continual use of the\npowder of the leaves and seed doth cure\nthe black jaundice. The distilled water of\nthe flowers is profitable for all the same\npurposes: it also helps surfeit, and alters\nthe fit of agues, if three or four ounces\nthereof, with as much of the water of the\nlesser Centaury, and a little sugar put therein,\nbe taken a little before the fit comes,\nand the party be laid down to sweat in his\nbed. The oil or water that is drawn from\nthe end of the green sticks heated in the\nfire, helps the tooth-ache. The juice of\nyoung branches made into an ointment of\nold hog’s grease, and anointed, or the young\nbranches bruised and heated in oil or hog’s\ngrease, and laid to the sides pained by\nwind, as in stitches, or the spleen, ease\nthem in once or twice using it. The same\nboiled in oil is the safest and surest medicine\nto kill lice in the head or body of any;\nand is an especial remedy for joint aches,\nand swollen knees, that come by the falling\ndown of humours.\nThe BROOM RAPE also is not without its virtues.\nThe decoction thereof in wine, is thought\nto be as effectual to void the stone in the\nkidney or bladder, and to provoke urine,\nas the Broom itself. The juice thereof is\na singular good help to cure as well green\nwounds, as old and filthy sores and malignant\nulcers. The insolate oil, wherein there\nhas been three or four repetitions of infusion\nof the top stalks, with flowers strained and[33]\ncleared, cleanses the skin from all manner\nof spots, marks, and freckles that rise either\nby the heat of the sun, or the malignity of\nhumours. As for the Broom and Broom-rape,\nMars owns them, and is exceeding\nprejudicial to the liver, I suppose by reason\nof the antipathy between Jupiter and Mars;\ntherefore if the liver be disaffected, minister\nnone of it.\nBUCK’S-HORN PLANTAIN.\nDescript.] This being sown of seed,\nrises up at first with small, long, narrow,\nhairy, dark green leaves like grass, without\nany division or gash in them, but those that\nfollow are gashed in on both sides the\nleaves into three or four gashes, and pointed\nat the ends, resembling the knags of a\nbuck’s horn (whereof it took its name), and\nbeing well wound round about the root\nupon the ground, in order one by another,\nthereby resembling the form of a star, from\namong which rise up divers hairy stalks,\nabout a hand’s breadth high, bearing every\none a small, long spiky head, like to those\nof the common Plantain having such like\nbloomings and seed after them.

The insolate oil, wherein there\nhas been three or four repetitions of infusion\nof the top stalks, with flowers strained and[33]\ncleared, cleanses the skin from all manner\nof spots, marks, and freckles that rise either\nby the heat of the sun, or the malignity of\nhumours. As for the Broom and Broom-rape,\nMars owns them, and is exceeding\nprejudicial to the liver, I suppose by reason\nof the antipathy between Jupiter and Mars;\ntherefore if the liver be disaffected, minister\nnone of it.\nBUCK’S-HORN PLANTAIN.\nDescript.] This being sown of seed,\nrises up at first with small, long, narrow,\nhairy, dark green leaves like grass, without\nany division or gash in them, but those that\nfollow are gashed in on both sides the\nleaves into three or four gashes, and pointed\nat the ends, resembling the knags of a\nbuck’s horn (whereof it took its name), and\nbeing well wound round about the root\nupon the ground, in order one by another,\nthereby resembling the form of a star, from\namong which rise up divers hairy stalks,\nabout a hand’s breadth high, bearing every\none a small, long spiky head, like to those\nof the common Plantain having such like\nbloomings and seed after them. The root\nis single, long and small, with divers strings\nat it.\nPlace.] They grow in sandy grounds,\nas in Tothill-fields by Westminster, and\ndivers other places of this land.\nTime.] They flower and seed in May,\nJune, and July, and their green leaves do\nin a manner abide fresh all the Winter.\nGovernment and virtues.] It is under the\ndominion of Saturn, and is of a gallant,\ndrying, and binding quality. This boiled\nin wine and drank, and some of the leaves\nput to the hurt place, is an excellent remedy\nfor the biting of the viper or adder,\nwhich I take to be one and the same. The\nsame being also drank, helps those that are\ntroubled with the stone in the reins or kidneys,\nby cooling the heat of the part afflicted,\nand strengthens them; also weak\nstomachs that cannot retain, but cast up\ntheir meat. It stays all bleeding both at\nmouth or nose; bloody urine or the bloody-flux,\nand stops the lask of the belly and\nbowels. The leaves hereof bruised and\nlaid to their sides that have an ague, suddenly\nease the fits; and the leaves and roots\napplied to the wrists, works the same effect.\nThe herb boiled in ale and wine, and given\nfor some mornings and evenings together,\nstays the distillation of hot and sharp\nrheums falling into the eyes from the head,\nand helps all sorts of sore eyes.\nBUCK’S HORN.\nIt is called Hart’s-horn, Herba-stella and\nHerba-stellaria, Sanguinaria, Herb-Eve,\nHerb-Ivy, Wort-Tresses, and Swine-Cresses.\nDescript.] They have many small and\nweak straggled branches trailing here and\nthere upon the ground: The leaves are\nmany, small and jagged, not much unlike\nto those of Buck’s-horn Plantain, but much\nsmaller, and not so hairy. The flowers\ngrow among the leaves in small, rough,\nwhitish clusters; the seeds are smaller and\nbrownish, of a bitter taste.\nPlace.] They grow in dry, barren, sandy\ngrounds.\nTime.] They flower and seed when the\nrest of the Plantains do.\nGovernment and virtues.] This is also\nunder the dominion of Saturn; the virtues\nare held to be the same as Buck’s-horn\nPlaintain, and therefore by all authors it is\njoined with it. The leaves bruised and applied\nto the place, stop bleeding. The\nherbs bruised and applied to warts, will\nmake them consume and waste in a short\ntime."

The first has a long\ncreeping and jointed root, sending forth\ntufts at each joint, from which joints rise\nlong, flat, slender, knotted stalks, even to\nthe top of the water, divided towards the\ntop into many branches, each carrying\ntwo leaves on both sides, being about two[40]\ninches long, and half an inch broad, thin\nand almost transparent; they look as though\nthey were torn; the flowers are long, thick,\nand whitish, set together almost like a\nbunch of grapes, which being gone, there\nsucceed, for the most part, sharp pointed\ngrains all together, containing a small white\nkernel in them.\nThe second differs not much from this,\nsave that it delights in more clean water;\nits stalks are not flat, but round; its leaves\nare not so long, but more pointed. As for\nthe place we need not determine, for their\nname shews they grow in water.",

It\nis excellently good for the rankness of the\ngums, a safe and present remedy for the\nking’s evil. They are excellent for the stone\nand gravel, especially the nuts, being dried.\nThey also resist poison, and bitings of\nvenomous beasts.\nCAMPION, WILD.\nDescript.] The wild White Campion\nhas many long and somewhat broad dark\ngreen leaves lying upon the ground, and\ndivers ribs therein, somewhat like plantain,\nbut somewhat hairy, broader, but not so\nlong. The hairy stalks rise up in the middle\nof them three or four feet high, and\nsometimes more, with divers great white\njoints at several places thereon, and two\nsuch like leaves thereat up to the top, sending\nforth branches at several joints also;\nall which bear on several foot-stalks white\nflowers at the tops of them, consisting of\nfive broad pointed leaves, every one cut in\non the end unto the middle, making them\nseem to be two a-piece, smelling somewhat\nsweet, and each of them standing in a\nlarge green striped hairy husk, large and\nround below next to the stalk. The seed is\nsmall and greyish in the hard heads that\ncome up afterwards. The root is white and\nlong, spreading divers fangs in the ground.\nThe Red wild Campion grows in the same\nmanner as the White; but its leaves are not\nso plainly ribbed, somewhat shorter, rounder,\nand more woolly in handling. The flowers\nare of the same form and bigness; but in\nsome of a pale, in others of a bright red\ncolour, cut in at the ends more finely, which\nmakes the leaves look more in number than\nthe other. The seeds and the roots are\nalike, the roots of both sorts abiding many\nyears.\nThere are forty-five kinds of Campion\nmore, those of them which are of a physical\nuse, having the like virtues with those\nabove described, which I take to be the two\nchief kinds.\nPlace.] They grow commonly through\nthis land by fields and hedge-sides, and\nditches.\nTime.] They flower in Summer, some\nearlier than others, and some abiding longer\nthan others.\nGovernment and virtues.] They belong\nto Saturn, and it is found by experience,\nthat the decoction of the herb, either in\nwhite or red wine being drank, doth stay\ninward bleedings, and applied outwardly\nit does the like; and being drank, helps\nto expel urine, being stopped, and gravel\nand stone in the reins and kidneys. Two\ndrams of the seed drank in wine, purges\nthe body of choleric humours, and helps\nthose that are stung by scorpions, or other\nvenomous beasts, and may be as effectual\nfor the plague.

The\nbathing with a decoction of Camomile\ntakes away weariness, eases pains, to what\npart of the body soever they be applied.\nIt comforts the sinews that are over-strained,\nmollifies all swellings: It moderately comforts\nall parts that have need of warmth,\ndigests and dissolves whatsoever has need\nthereof, by a wonderful speedy property.\nIt eases all pains of the cholic and stone,\nand all pains and torments of the belly,\nand gently provokes urine. The flowers\nboiled in posset-drink provokes sweat, and\nhelps to expel all colds, aches, and pains\nwhatsoever, and is an excellent help to\nbring down women’s courses. Syrup made\nof the juice of Camomile, with the flowers,\nin white wine, is a remedy against the\njaundice and dropsy. The flowers boiled\nin lye, are good to wash the head, and\ncomfort both it and the brain.

The leaves are\nsmall and somewhat round; the root small\nand hard, perishing every year.

    "government_virtues": "They are under\nthe dominion of the Sun, as appears in that\ntheir flowers open and shut as the Sun, either\nshews or hides his face. This herb, boiled[45]\nand drank, purges choleric and gross\nhumours, and helps the sciatica; it opens\nobstructions of the liver, gall, and spleen,\nhelps the jaundice, and eases the pains in\nthe sides and hardness of the spleen, used\noutwardly, and is given with very good\neffect in agues. It helps those that have\nthe dropsy, or the green-sickness, being\nmuch used by the Italians in powder for\nthat purpose. It kill the worms in the\nbelly, as is found by experience. The\ndecoction thereof, viz. the tops of the stalks,\nwith the leaves and flowers, is good against\nthe cholic, and to bring down women’s\ncourses, helps to avoid the dead birth, and\neases pains of the mother, and is very effectual\nin all pains of the joints, as the\ngout, cramps, or convulsions. A dram of\nthe powder taken in wine is a wonderful\ngood help against the biting and poison of\nan adder. The juice of the herb with\na little honey put to it, is good to clear the\neyes from dimness, mists and clouds that\noffend or hinder sight. It is singularly\ngood both for green and fresh wounds, as\nalso for old ulcers and sores, to close up the\none and cleanse the other, and perfectly to\ncure them both, although they are hollow\nor fistulous; the green herb especially, being\nbruised and laid thereto. The decoction\nthereof dropped into the ears, cleanses\nthem from worms, cleanses the foul ulcers\nand spreading scabs of the head, and takes\naway all freckles, spots, and marks in the\nskin, being washed with it; the herb is so\nsafe you cannot fail in the using of it, only\ngiving it inwardly for inward diseases.\nIt is very wholesome, but not very toothsome.\nThere is beside these, another small\nCentaury, which bears a yellow flower; in\nall other respects it is like the former, save\nthat the leaves are larger, and of a darker\ngreen, and the stalks pass through the midst\nof them, as it does in the herb Thorowan.\nThey are all of them, as I told you, under\nthe government of the Sun; yet this, if\nyou observe it, you shall find an excellant\ntruth; in diseases of the blood, use the red\nCentaury; if of choler, use the yellow;\nbut if phlegm or water, you will find the\nwhite best.\nTHE CHERRY-TREE.\nI suppose there are few but know this\ntree, for its fruit’s sake; and therefore\nI shall spare writing a description thereof.\nPlace.] For the place of its growth, it\nis afforded room in every orchard.\nGovernment and virtues.] It is a tree of\nVenus. Cherries, as they are of different\ntastes, so they are of different qualities.\nThe sweet pass through the stomach and\nthe belly more speedily, but are of little\nnourishment; the tart or sour are more\npleasing to an hot stomach, procure appetite\nto meat, to help and cut tough phlegm,\nand gross humours; but when these are\ndried, they are more binding to the belly\nthan when they are fresh, being cooling in\nhot diseases, and welcome to the stomach,\nand provokes urine. The gum of the Cherry-tree,\ndesolved in wine is good for a cold,\ncough, and hoarseness of the throat; mends\nthe colour in the face, sharpens the eye-sight,\nprovokes appetite, and helps to break\nand expel the stone, and dissolved, the\nwater thereof is much used to break the\nstone, and to expel gravel and wind.\nWINTER-CHERRIES.\nDescript.] The Winter Cherry has a\nrunning or creeping root in the ground, of\nthe bigness many times one’s little finger,\nshooting forth at several joints in several\nplaces, whereby it quickly spreads a great\ncompass of ground. The stalk rises not\nabove a yard high, whereon are set many\nbroad and long green leaves, somewhat\nlike nightshades, but larger; at the joints,\nwhereof come forth whitish flowers made\nof five leaves a piece, which afterwards[46]\nturn into green berries inclosed with thin\nskins, which change to be reddish when\nthey grow ripe, the berry likewise being\nreddish, and as large as a cherry; wherein\nare contained many flat and yellowish seeds\nlying within the pulp, which being gathered\nand strung up, are kept all the year to be\nused upon occasions.\nPlace.] They grow not naturally in this\nland, but are cherished in gardens for their\nvirtues.\nTime.] They flower not until the middle\nor latter end of July; and the fruit is ripe\nabout August, or the beginning of September.\nGovernment and virtues.] This also is a\nplant of Venus. They are of great use in\nphysic: The leaves being cooling, may be\nused in inflammations, but not opening as\nthe berries and fruit are; which by drawing\ndown the urine provoke it to be voided\nplentifully when it is stopped or grown hot,\nsharp, and painful in the passage; it is\ngood also to expel the stone and gravel out\nof the reins, kidneys and bladder, helping\nto dissolve the stone, and voiding it by grit\nor gravel sent forth in the urine; it also\nhelps much to cleanse inward imposthumes\nor ulcers in the reins of bladder, or in those\nthat void a bloody or foul urine. The\ndistilled water of the fruit, or the leaves\ntogether with them, or the berries, green or\ndry, distilled with a little milk and drank\nmorning and evening with a little sugar, is\neffectual to all the purposes before specified,\nand especially against the heat and sharpness\nof the urine.

The ordinary Costmary,\nas well as Maudlin, provokes urine\nabundantly, and moistens the hardness of\nthe mother; it gently purges choler and\nphlegm, extenuating that which is gross,\nand cutting that which is tough and glutinous,\ncleanses that which is foul, and\nhinders putrefaction and corruption; it\ndissolves without attraction, opens obstructions,\nand helps their evil effects, and it is a\nwonderful help to all sorts of dry agues.\nIt is astringent to the stomach, and\nstrengthens the liver, and all the other inward\nparts; and taken in whey works more\neffectually. Taken fasting in the morning,\nit is very profitable for pains in the head\nthat are continual, and to stay, dry up, and\nconsume all thin rheums or distillations\nfrom the head into the stomach, and helps\nmuch to digest raw humours that are\ngathered therein. It is very profitable for\nthose that are fallen into a continual evil\ndisposition of the whole body, called\nCachexia, but especially in the beginning\nof the disease. It is an especial friend and\nhelps to evil, weak and cold livers. The\nseed is familiarly given to children for the\nworms, and so is the infusion of the flowers\nin white wine given them to the quantity of[56]\ntwo ounces at a time; it makes an excellent\nsalve to cleanse and heal old ulcers, being\nboiled with oil of olive, and Adder’s tongue\nwith it, and after it is strained, put a little\nwax, rosin, and turpentine, to bring it to a\nconvenient body.\nCUDWEED, OR COTTONWEED.\nBesides Cudweed and Cottonweed, it is\nalso Called Chaffweed, Dwarf Cotton, and\nPetty Cotton.\nDescript.] The common Cudweed rises\nup with one stalk sometimes, and sometimes\nwith two or three, thick set on all\nsides with small, long and narrow whitish\nor woody leaves, from the middle of the\nstalk almost up to the top, with every leaf\nstands small flowers of a dun or brownish\nyellow colour, or not so yellow as others;\nin which herbs, after the flowers are fallen,\ncome small seed wrapped up, with the down\ntherein, and is carried away with the wind;\nthe root is small and thready.\nThere are other sorts hereof, which are\nsomewhat less than the former, not much\ndifferent, save only that the stalks and\nleaves are shorter, so that the flowers are\npaler and more open.\nPlace.] They grow in dry, barren, sandy,\nand gravelly grounds, in most places of\nthis land.\nTime.] They flower about July, some\nearlier, some later, and their seed is ripe in\nAugust.\nGovernment and virtues.] Venus is Lady\nof it. The plants are all astringent, binding,\nor drying, and therefore profitable for\ndefluctions of rheum from the head, and to\nstay fluxes of blood wheresoever, the decoction\nbeing made into red wine and\ndrank, or the powder taken therein. It also\nhelps the bloody-flux, and eases the torments\nthat come thereby, stays the immoderate\ncourses of women, and is also good for\ninward or outward wounds, hurts, and\nbruises, and helps children both of bursting\nand the worms, and being either drank or\ninjected, for the disease called Tenesmus,\nwhich is an often provocation to the stool\nwithout doing any thing. The green leaves\nbruised, and laid to any green wound, stays\nthe bleeding, and heals it up quickly. The\njuice of the herb taken in wine and milk,\nis, as Pliny saith, a sovereign remedy\nagainst the mumps and quinsey; and further\nsaith, That whosoever shall so take it, shall\nnever be troubled with that disease again.\nCOWSLIPS, OR PEAGLES.\nBoth the wild and garden Cowslips are\nso well known, that I neither trouble myself\nnor the reader with a description of\nthem.\nTime.] They flower in April and May.\nGovernment and virtues.] Venus lays\nclaim to this herb as her own, and it is\nunder the sign Aries, and our city dames\nknow well enough the ointment or distilled\nwater of it adds beauty, or at least restores\nit when it is lost. The flowers are held to\nbe more effectual than the leaves, and the\nroots of little use. An ointment being\nmade with them, takes away spots and\nwrinkles of the skin, sun-burning, and\nfreckles, and adds beauty exceedingly;\nthey remedy all infirmities of the head\ncoming of heat and wind, as vertigo, ephialtes,\nfalse apparitions, phrensies, falling-sickness,\npalsies, convulsions, cramps, pains\nin the nerves; the roots ease pains in the\nback and bladder, and open the passages of\nurine. The leaves are good in wounds,\nand the flowers take away trembling.

This\nroot was longer, until the devil (as the\nfriars say) bit away the rest of it for spite,\nenvying its usefulness to mankind; for\nsure he was not troubled with any disease\nfor which it is proper.\nThere are two other sorts hereof, in\nnothing unlike the former, save that the\none bears white, and the other bluish-coloured\nflowers.\nPlace.] The first grows as well in dry\nmeadows and fields as moist, in many\nplaces of this land: But the other two are\nmore rare, and hard to be met with, yet\nthey are both found growing wild about\nAppledore, near Rye in Kent.\nTime.] They flower not usually until\nAugust.\nGovernment and virtues.] The plant is\nvenereal, pleasing, and harmless. The herb\nor the root (all that the devil hath left of\nit) being boiled in wine, and drank, is very\npowerful against the plague, and all pestilential\ndiseases or fevers, poisons also,\nand the bitings of venemous beasts: It\nhelps also those that are inwardly bruised\nby any casuality, or outwardly by falls or\nblows, dissolving the clotted blood; and\nthe herb or root beaten and outwardly\napplied, takes away the black and blue\nmarks that remain in the skin. The decoction\nof the herb, with honey of roses\nput therein, is very effectual to help the\ninveterate tumours and swellings of the\nalmonds and throat, by often gargling the\nmouth therewith. It helps also to procure\nwomen’s courses, and eases all pains of the\nmother and to break and discuss wind\ntherein, and in the bowels. The powder of\nthe root taken in drink, drives forth the\nworms in the body. The juice or distilled\nwater of the herb, is effectual for green\nwounds, or old sores, and cleanses the\nbody inwardly, and the seed outwardly,\nfrom sores, scurf, itch, pimples, freckles,\nmorphew, or other deformities thereof,\nespecially if a little vitriol be dissolved\ntherein."

This is accounted\nthe most effectual for melancholy\ndiseases, and to purge black or burnt choler,\nwhich is the cause of many diseases of the\nhead and brain, as also for the trembling of\nthe heart, faintings and swoonings.

The distilled\nwater alone, or with a little wormseed,\nkills the worms in children.\nThe way of use is to bruise the roots, and\nhaving well boiled them in white wine,\ndrink the decoction: ’Tis opening but not\npurging, very safe: ’Tis a remedy against\nall diseases coming of stopping, and such\nare half those that are incident to the body\nof man; and although a gardener be of\nanother opinion, yet a physician holds half\nan acre of them to be worth five acres of\nCarrots twice told over.\nDOVE’S-FOOT, OR CRANE’S-BILL.\nDescript.] This has divers small, round,\npale-green leaves, cut in about the edges,\nmuch like mallow, standing upon long,\nreddish, hairy stalks lying in a round compass\nupon the ground; among which rise\nup two or three, or more, reddish, jointed,\nslender, weak, hairy stalks, with some like\nleaves thereon, but smaller, and more cut in\nup to the tops, where grow many very\nsmall bright red flowers of five leaves\na-piece; after which follow small heads,\nwith small short beaks pointed forth, as all\nother sorts of those herbs do.\nPlace.] It grows in pasture grounds, and\nby the path-sides in many places, and will\nalso be in gardens.\nTime.] It flowers in June, July, and\nAugust, some earlier and some later; and\nthe seed is ripe quickly after.\nGovernment and virtues.] It is a very\ngentle, though martial plant. It is found\nby experience to be singularly good for wind\ncholic, as also to expel the stone and gravel\nin the kidneys. The decoction thereof in\nwine, is an excellent good cure for those\nthat have inward wounds, hurts, or bruises,\nboth to stay the bleeding, to dissolve and\nexpel the congealed blood, and to heal the\nparts, as also to cleanse and heal outward\nsores, ulcers, and fistulas; and for green\nwounds, many do only bruise the herb, and\napply it to the places, and it heals them\nquickly. The same decoction in wine\nfomented to any place pained with the\ngout, or to joint-aches, or pains of the\nsinews, gives much ease. The powder or\ndecoction of the herb taken for some time\ntogether, is found by experience to be singularly\ngood for ruptures and burstings in\npeople, either young or old.\nDUCK’S MEAT.\nThis is so well known to swim on the\ntops of standing waters, as ponds, pools,\nand ditches, that it is needless further to\ndescribe it.\nGovernment and virtues.] Cancer claims\nthe herb, and the Moon will be Lady of it;\na word is enough to a wise man. It is\neffectual to help inflammations, and St.\nAnthony’s Fire, as also the gout, either\napplied by itself, or in a poultice with Barley\nmeal. The distilled water by some is\nhighly esteemed against all inward inflammations\nand pestilent fevers; as also to\nhelp the redness of the eyes, and swellings\nof privities, and of the breasts before they\nbe grown too much. The fresh herb applied\nto the forehead, eases the pains of\nthe head-ache coming of heat.\n[67]\nDOWN, OR COTTON-THISTLE.\nDescript.] This has large leaves lying\non the ground, somewhat cut in, and as it\nwere crumpled on the edges, of a green\ncolour on the upper side, but covered with\nlong hairy wool, or Cotton Down, set with\nmost sharp and cruel pricks, from the middle\nof whose head of flowers, thrust forth\nmany purplish crimson threads, and sometimes\n(although very seldom) white ones.\nThe seed that follows in the heads, lying\nin a great deal of white down, is somewhat\nlarge, long, and round, like the seed\nof ladies thistle, but paler. The root is\ngreat and thick, spreading much, yet it\nusually dies after seed-time.\nPlace.] It grows in divers ditches,\nbanks, and in corn-fields, and highways,\ngenerally every where throughout the land.\nTime.] It flowers and bears seed about\nthe end of Summer, when other thistles do\nflower and seed.\nGovernment and virtues.] Mars owns\nthe plant, and manifest to the world, that\nthough it may hurt your finger, it will help\nyour body; for I fancy it much for the\nensuing virtues. Pliny and Dioscorides\nwrite, That the leaves and roots thereof\ntaken in drink, help those that have a crick\nin their neck; whereby they cannot turn\ntheir neck but their whole body must turn\nalso (sure they do not mean those that have\ngot a crick in their neck by being under\nthe hangman’s hand.) Galen saith, that\nthe root and leaves hereof are of a healing\nquality, and good for such persons as have\ntheir bodies drawn together by some spasm\nor convulsion, as it is with children that\nhave the rickets."

    "name": "FENNEL",
    "description": "The common Sow-Fennel\nhas divers branched stalks of thick and\nsomewhat long leaves, three for the most\npart joined together at a place, among\nwhich arises a crested straight stalk, less\nthan Fennel, with some joints thereon, and\nleaves growing thereat, and towards the\ntops some branches issuing from thence;\nlikewise on the tops of the stalks and\nbranches stand divers tufts of yellow flowers,\nwhereafter grows somewhat flat, thin, and\nyellowish seed, bigger than Fennel seed.\nThe roots grow great and deep, with many\nother parts and fibres about them of a\nstrong scent like hot brimstone, and yield\nforth a yellowish milk, or clammy juice,\nalmost like a gum.",
    "place": "It grows on dry sandy ground",
    "time": "It seldom flowers before July,",
    "government_virtues": "One good old\nfashion is not yet left off, viz. to boil Fennel\nwith fish; for it consumes that phlegmatic\nhumour, which fish most plentifully afford\nand annoy the body with, though few that\nuse it know wherefore they do it; I suppose\nthe reason of its benefit this way is because\nit is an herb of Mercury, and under Virgo,\nand therefore bears antipathy to Pisces.\nFennel is good to break wind, to provoke\nurine, and ease the pains of the stone, and\nhelps to break it. The leaves or seed,\nboiled in barley water and drank are good\nfor nurses, to increase their milk, and make\nit more wholesome for the child. The\nleaves, or rather the seeds, boiled in water,\nstays the hiccough, and takes away the\nloathings which oftentimes happen to the\nstomachs of sick and feverish persons and\nallays the heat thereof. The seed boiled in\nwine and drank, is good for those that are\nbitten with serpents, or have eaten poisonous\nherbs, or mushrooms. The seed and\nthe roots much more, help to open obstructions\nof the liver, spleen, and gall, and\nthereby help the painful and windy swellings\nof the spleen, and the yellow jaundice;\nas also the gout and cramps. The seed is\nof good use in medicines to help shortness\nof breath and wheezing by stopping of the\nlungs. It helps also to bring down the\ncourses, and to cleanse the parts after\ndelivery. The roots are of most use in\nphysic drinks, and broth that are taken to\ncleanse the blood, to open obstructions of\nthe liver, to provoke urine, and amend the\nill colour in the face after sickness, and to\ncause a good habit through the body.[74]\nBoth leaves, seeds, and roots thereof are\nmuch used in drink or broth, to make people\nmore lean that are too fat. The distilled\nwater of the whole herb, or the condensate\njuice dissolved, but especially the\nnatural juice, that in some counties issues\nout hereof of its own accord, dropped into\nthe eyes, cleanses them from mists and\nfilms that hinder the sight. The sweet\nFennel is much weaker in physical uses\nthan the common Fennel. The wild Fennel\nis stronger and hotter than the tame,\nand therefore most powerful against the\nstone, but not so effectual to encrease milk,\nbecause of its dryness.\nSOW-FENNEL, OR HOG’S-FENNEL.\nBesides the common name in English,\nHog’s Fennel, and the Latin name Peucidanum,\nis called Hoar-strange, and Hoar-strong,\nSulphur-wort, and Brimstone-wort.\nDescript.] The common Sow-Fennel\nhas divers branched stalks of thick and\nsomewhat long leaves, three for the most\npart joined together at a place, among\nwhich arises a crested straight stalk, less\nthan Fennel, with some joints thereon, and\nleaves growing thereat, and towards the\ntops some branches issuing from thence;\nlikewise on the tops of the stalks and\nbranches stand divers tufts of yellow flowers,\nwhereafter grows somewhat flat, thin, and\nyellowish seed, bigger than Fennel seed.\nThe roots grow great and deep, with many\nother parts and fibres about them of a\nstrong scent like hot brimstone, and yield\nforth a yellowish milk, or clammy juice,\nalmost like a gum.\nPlace.] It grows plentifully in the salt\nlow marshes near Feversham in Kent.\nTime.] It flowers plentifully in July and\nAugust.\nGovernment and virtues.] This is also an\nherb of Mercury. The juice of Sow-Fennel\n(saith Dioscorides, and Galen,) used with\nvinegar and rose water, or the juice with a\nlittle Euphorbium put to the nose, helps\nthose that are troubled with the lethargy,\nfrenzy, giddiness of the head, the falling\nsickness, long and inveterate head-aches,\nthe palsy, sciatica, and the cramp, and\ngenerally all the diseases of the sinews, used\nwith oil and vinegar. The juice dissolved\nin wine, or put into an egg, is good for a\ncough, or shortness of breath, and for those\nthat are troubled with wind in the body.\nIt purges the belly gently, expels the hardness\nof the spleen, gives ease to women\nthat have sore travail in child-birth, and\neases the pains of the reins and bladder,\nand also the womb. A little of the juice\ndissolved in wine, and dropped into the\nears, eases much of the pains in them, and\nput into a hollow tooth, eases the pain\nthereof. The root is less effectual to all\nthe aforesaid disorders; yet the powder of\nthe root cleanses foul ulcers, being put into\nthem, and takes out splinters of broken\nbones, or other things in the flesh, and\nheals them up perfectly: as also, dries up\nold and inveterate running sores, and is of\nadmirable virtue in all green wounds.\nFIG-WORT, OR THROAT-WORT.\nDescript.] Common great Fig-wort sends\ndivers great, strong, hard, square brown\nstalks, three or four feet high, whereon grow\nlarge, hard, and dark green leaves, two at\na joint, harder and larger than Nettle\nleaves, but not stinking; at the tops of the\nstalks stand many purple flowers set in\nhusks, which are sometimes gaping and\nopen, somewhat like those of Water Betony;\nafter which come hard round heads, with\na small point in the middle, wherein lie\nsmall brownish seed. The root is great,\nwhite, and thick, with many branches at it,\ngrowing aslope under the upper crust of\nthe ground, which abides many years, but\nkeeps not his green leaves in Winter.\nPlace.] It grows frequently in moist[75]\nand shadowy woods, and in the lower parts\nof the fields and meadows.\nTime.] It flowers about July, and the\nseed will be ripe about a month after the\nflowers are fallen.\nGovernment and virtues.] Some Latin\nauthors call it Cervicaria, because it is appropriated\nto the neck; and we Throat-wort,\nbecause it is appropriated to the\nthroat. Venus owns the herb, and the\nCelestial Bull will not deny it; therefore\na better remedy cannot be for the king’s\nevil, because the Moon that rules the disease,\nis exalted there. The decoction of the\nherb taken inwardly, and the bruised herb\napplied outwardly, dissolves clotted and\ncongealed blood within the body, coming\nby any wounds, bruise, or fall; and is no\nless effectual for the king’s evil, or any\nother knobs, kernel, bunches, or wens\ngrowing in the flesh wheresoever; and for\nthe hæmorrhoids, or piles. An ointment\nmade hereof may be used at all times when\nthe fresh herb is not to be had. The distilled\nwater of the whole plant, roots and\nall, is used for the same purposes, and dries\nup the superfluous, virulent moisture of\nhollow and corroding ulcers; it takes away\nall redness, spots, and freckles in the face,\nas also the scurf, and any foul deformity\ntherein, and the leprosy likewise.\nFILIPENDULA, OR DROP-WORT.\nDescript.] This sends forth many leaves,\nsome larger, some smaller, set on each side\nof a middle rib, and each of them dented\nabout the edges, somewhat resembling wild\nTansy, or rather Agrimony, but harder in\nhandling; among which rise up one or\nmore stalks, two or three feet high, with the\nleaves growing thereon, and sometimes also\ndivided into other branches spreading at the\ntop into many white, sweet-smelling flowers,\nconsisting of five leaves a-piece, with some\nthreads in the middle of them, standing\ntogether in a pith or umble, each upon a\nsmall foot stalk, which after they have been\nblown upon a good while, do fall away,\nand in their places appear small, round,\nchaffy heads like buttons, wherein are the\nchaffy seeds set and placed. The root\nconsists of many small, black, tuberous\npieces, fastened together by many small,\nlong, blackish strings, which run from one\nto another.\nPlace.] It grows in many places of this\nland, in the corners of dry fields and meadows,\nand the hedge sides.\nTime.] They flower in June and July,\nand their seed is ripe in August.\nGovernment and virtues.] It is under the\ndominion of Venus. It effectually opens\nthe passages of the urine, helps the stranguary;\nthe stone in the kidneys or bladder,\nthe gravel, and all other pains of the bladder\nand reins, by taking the roots in powder,\nor a decoction of them in white wine,\nwith a little honey. The roots made into\npowder, and mixed with honey in the form\nof an electuary, doth much help them\nwhose stomachs are swollen, dissolving and\nbreaking the wind which was the cause\nthereof; and is also very effectual for all\nthe diseases of the lungs, as shortness of\nbreath, wheezing, hoarseness of the throat,\nand the cough; and to expectorate tough\nphlegm, or any other parts thereabout.\nTHE FIG-TREE.\nTo give a description of a tree so well\nknown to every body that keep it in his\ngarden, were needless. They prosper very\nwell in our English gardens, yet are fitter\nfor medicine than for any other profit which\nis gotten by the fruit of them.\nGovernment and virtues.] The tree is\nunder the dominion of Jupiter. The milk\nthat issues out from the leaves or branches\nwhere they are broken off, being dropped\nupon warts, takes them away. The decoction[76]\nof the leaves is excellently good to\nwash sore heads with: and there is scarcely\na better remedy for the leprosy than it is.\nIt clears the face also of morphew, and the\nbody of white scurf, scabs, and running\nsores. If it be dropped into old fretting\nulcers, it cleanses out the moisture, and\nbrings up the flesh; because you cannot\nhave the leaves green all the year, you may\nmake an ointment of them whilst you can.\nA decoction of the leaves being drank inwardly,\nor rather a syrup made of them,\ndissolves congealed blood caused by bruises\nor falls, and helps the bloody flux. The\nashes of the wood made into an ointment\nwith hog’s grease, helps kibes and chilblains.\nThe juice being put into an hollow tooth,\neases pain: as also pain and noise in the\nears, being dropped into them; and deafness.\nAn ointment made of the juice and\nhog’s grease, is an excellent remedy for the\nbitten of mad dogs, or other venomous\nbeasts as most are. A syrup made of the\nleaves, or green fruit, is excellently good for\ncoughs, hoarseness, or shortness of breath,\nand all diseases of the breast and lungs; it\nis also extremely good for the dropsy and\nfalling sickness. They say that the Fig\nTree, as well as the Bay Tree, is never\nhurt by lightning; as also, if you tie a bull,\nbe he ever so mad, to a Fig Tree, he will\nquickly become tame and gentle. As for\nsuch figs as come from beyond sea, I\nhave little to say, because I write not of\nexoticks.\nTHE YELLOW WATER-FLAG, OR FLOWER-DE-LUCE.\nDescript.] This grows like the Flower-de-luce,\nbut it has much longer and narrower\nsad green leaves, joined together in\nthat fashion; the stalk also growing oftentimes\nas high, bearing small yellow flowers\nshaped like the Flower-de-luce, with three\nfalling leaves, and other three arched that\ncover their bottoms; but instead of the\nthree upright leaves, as the Flower-de-luce\nhas, this has only three short pieces standing\nin their places, after which succeed\nthick and long three square heads, containing\nin each part somewhat big and flat\nseed, like those of the Flower-de-luce. The\nroot is long and slender, of a pale brownish\ncolour on the outside, and of a horseflesh\ncolour on the inside, with many hard fibres\nthereat, and very harsh in taste.\nPlace.] It usually grows in watery\nditches, ponds, lakes, and moor sides, which\nare always overflowed with water.\nTime.] It flowers in July, and the seed\nis ripe in August.\nGovernment and virtues.] It is under the\ndominion of the Moon. The root of this\nWater-flag is very astringent, cooling, and\ndrying; and thereby helps all lasks and\nfluxes, whether of blood or humours, as\nbleeding at the mouth, nose, or other parts,\nbloody flux, and the immoderate flux of\nwomen’s courses. The distilled water of\nthe whole herb, flowers and roots, is a\nsovereign good remedy for watering eyes,\nboth to be dropped into them, and to have\ncloths or sponges wetted therein, and applied\nto the forehead: It also helps the\nspots and blemishes that happen in and\nabout the eyes, or in any other parts: The\nsaid water fomented on swellings and hot\ninflammations of women’s breasts, upon\ncancers also, and those spreading ulcers\ncalled Noli me tangere, do much good: It\nhelps also foul ulcers in the privities of man\nor woman; but an ointment made of the\nflowers is better for those external applications.\nFLAX-WEED, OR TOAD-FLAX.\nDescript.] Our common Flax-weed has\ndivers stalks full fraught with long and\nnarrow ash-coloured leaves, and from the\nmiddle of them almost upward, stored with[77]\na number of pale yellow flowers, of a strong\nunpleasant scent, with deeper yellow\nmouths, and blackish flat seed in round\nheads. The root is somewhat woody and\nwhite, especially the main downright one,\nwith many fibres, abiding many years,\nshooting forth roots every way round about,\nand new branches every year.\nPlace.] This grows throughout this land,\nboth by the way sides and in meadows, as\nalso by hedge-sides, and upon the sides of\nbanks, and borders of fields.\nTime.] It flowers in Summer, and the\nseed is ripe usually before the end of\nAugust.\nGovernment and virtues.] Mars owns the\nherb: In Sussex we call it Gallwort, and\nlay it in our chicken’s water to cure them\nof the gall; it relieves them when they are\ndrooping. This is frequently used to spend\nthe abundance of those watery humours by\nurine which cause the dropsy. The decoction\nof the herb, both leaves and flowers,\nin wine, taken and drank, doth somewhat\nmove the belly downwards, opens obstructions\nof the liver, and helps the yellow\njaundice; expels poison, provokes women’s\ncourses, drives forth the dead child, and\nafter-birth. The distilled water of the herb\nand flowers is effectual for all the same purposes;\nbeing drank with a dram of the\npowder of the seeds of bark or the roots of\nWall-wort, and a little Cinnamon, for certain\ndays together, it is held a singular remedy\nfor the dropsy. The juice of the herb,\nor the distilled water, dropped into the eyes,\nis a certain remedy for all heat, inflammation,\nand redness in them. The juice or\nwater put into foul ulcers, whether they be\ncancerous or fistulous, with tents rolled\ntherein, or parts washed and injected therewith,\ncleanses them thoroughly from the\nbottom, and heals them up safely. The\nsame juice or water also cleanses the skin\nwonderfully of all sorts of deformity, as\nleprosy, morphew, scurf, wheals, pimples,\nor spots, applied of itself, or used with some\npowder of Lupines.\nFLEA-WORT.\nDescript.] Ordinary Flea-wort rises\nup with a stalk two feet high or more, full\nof joints and branches on every side up to\nthe top, and at every joint two small, long\nand narrow whitish green leaves somewhat\nhairy. At the top of every branch stand\ndivers small, short scaly, or chaffy heads\nout of which come forth small whitish\nyellow threads, like to those of the Plantain\nherbs, which are the bloomings of\nflowers. The seed enclosed in these heads\nis small and shining while it is fresh, very\nlike unto fleas both for colour and bigness,\nbut turning black when it grows old. The\nroot is not long, but white, hard and woody,\nperishing every year, and rising again of\nits own seed for divers years, if it be suffered\nto shed: The whole plant is somewhat\nwhitish and hairy, smelling somewhat like\nrosin.\nThere is another sort hereof, differing not\nfrom the former in the manner of growing,\nbut only that the stalk and branches being\nsomewhat greater, do a little more bow\ndown to the ground: The leaves are somewhat\ngreater, the heads somewhat less, the\nseed alike; and the root and leaves abide\nall winter, and perish not as the former.\nPlace.] The first grows only in gardens,\nthe second plentifully in fields that are\nnear the sea.\nTime.] They flower in July or thereabouts.\nGovernment and virtues.] The herb is\ncold, and dry, and saturnine. I suppose\nit obtained the name of Flea-wort, because\nthe seeds are so like Fleas. The seeds fried,\nand taken, stays the flux or lask of the\nbelly, and the corrosions that come by reason\nof hot choleric, or sharp and malignant\nhumours, or by too much purging of any\nviolent medicine, as Scammony, or the[78]\nlike. The mucilage of the seed made with\nRose-water, and a little sugar-candy put\nthereto, is very good in all hot agues and\nburning fevers, and other inflammations, to\ncool the thirst, and lenify the dryness and\nroughness of the tongue and throat. It\nhelps also hoarseness of the voice, and diseases\nof the breast and lungs, caused by\nheat, or sharp salt humours, and the pleurisy\nalso. The mucilage of the seed made\nwith Plantain water, whereunto the yoke of\nan egg or two, and a little Populeon are\nput, is a most safe and sure remedy to ease\nthe sharpness, pricking, and pains of the\nhæmorrhoids or piles, if it be laid on a\ncloth, and bound thereto. It helps all inflammations\nin any part of the body, and\nthe pains that come thereby, as the headache\nand megrims, and all hot imposthumes,\nswellings, or breaking out of the skin, as\nblains, wheals, pushes, purples, and the\nlike, as also the joints of those that are out\nof joint, the pains of the gout and sciatica,\nthe burstings of young children, and the\nswellings of the navel, applied with oil of\nroses and vinegar. It is also good to heal\nthe nipples and sore breasts of women,\nbeing often applied thereunto. The juice\nof the herb with a little honey put into the\nears helps the running of them, and the\nworms breeding in them: The same also\nmixed with hog’s grease, and applied to\ncorrupt and filthy ulcers, cleanses them\nand heals them.\nFLUX-WEED.\nDescript.] It rises up with a round\nupright hard stalk, four or five feet high,\nspread into sundry branches, whereon grow\nmany greyish green leaves, very finely cut\nand severed into a number of short and\nalmost round parts. The flowers are very\nsmall and yellow, growing spike fashion,\nafter which come small long pods, with\nsmall yellowish seed in them. The root is\nlong and woody, perishing every year.\nThere is another sort, differing in nothing,\nsave only it has somewhat broad leaves;\nthey have a strong evil saviour, being\nsmelled unto, and are of a drying taste.\nPlace.] They flower wild in the fields\nby hedge-sides and highways, and among\nrubbish and other places.\nTime.] They flower and seed quickly\nafter, namely in June and July.\nGovernment and virtues.] This herb is\nsaturnine also. Both the herb and seed of\nFlux-weed is of excellent use to stay the flux\nor lask of the belly, being drank in water\nwherein gads of steel heated have been\noften quenched; and is no less effectual\nfor the same purpose than Plantain or Comfrey,\nand to restrain any other flux of blood\nin man or woman, as also to consoladate\nbones broken or out of joint. The juice\nthereof drank in wine, or the decoction of\nthe herb drank, doth kill the worms in the\nstomach or belly, or the worms that grow\nin putrid and filthy ulcers, and made into\na salve doth quickly heal all old sores, how\nfoul or malignant soever they be. The\ndistilled water of the herb works the same\neffect, although somewhat weaker, yet it\nis a fair medicine, and more acceptable to\nbe taken. It is called Flux-weed because\nit cures the flux, and for its uniting broken\nbones, &c. Paracelsus extols it to the skies.\nIt is fitting that syrup, ointment, and\nplaisters of it were kept in your house.\nFLOWER-DE-LUCE.\nIt is so well known, being nourished up\nin most gardens, that I shall not need to\nspent time in writing a description thereof.\nTime.] The flaggy kinds thereof have\nthe most physical uses; the dwarf kinds\nthereof flowers in April, the greater sorts\nin May.\nGovernment and virtues.] The herb is\nLuner. The juice or decoction of the green\nroot of the flaggy kind of Flower-de-luce,\nwith a little honey drank, doth purge and[79]\ncleanse the stomach of gross and tough\nphlegm, and choler therein; it helps the\njaundice and the dropsy, evacuating those\nhumours both upwards and downwards;\nand because it somewhat hurts the stomach,\nis not to be taken without honey and spikenard.\nThe same being drank, doth ease\nthe pains and torments of the belly and\nsides, the shaking of agues, the diseases of\nthe liver and spleen, the worms of the belly,\nthe stone in the reins, convulsions and\ncramps that come of old humours; it also\nhelps those whose seed passes from them\nunawares: It is a remedy against the\nbitings and stingings of venomous creatures,\nbeing boiled in water and vinegar\nand drank. Boiled in water and drank, it\nprovokes urine, helps the cholic, brings\ndown women’s courses; and made up into\na pessary with honey, and put up into the\nbody, draws forth the dead child. It is\nmuch commended against the cough, to\nexpectorate rough phlegm. It much eases\npains in the head, and procures sleep;\nbeing put into the nostrils it procures\nsneezing, and thereby purges the head of\nphlegm. The juice of the root applied to\nthe piles or hæmorrhoids, gives much ease.\nThe decoction of the roots gargled in the\nmouth, eases the tooth-ache, and helps the\nstinking breath. Oil called Oleum Irinum,\nif it be rightly made of the great broad\nflag Flower-de-luce and not of the great\nbulbous blue Flower-de-luce, (as is used by\nsome apothecaries) and roots of the same, of\nthe flaggy kinds, is very effectual to warm\nand comfort all cold joints and sinews, as\nalso the gout and sciatica, and mollifies,\ndissolves and consumes tumours and swellings\nin any part of the body, as also of the\nmatrix; it helps the cramp, or convulsions\nof the sinews. The head and temples\nanointed therewith, helps the catarrh or\nthin rheum distilled from thence; and used\nupon the breast or stomach, helps to extenuate\nthe cold tough phlegm; it helps\nalso the pains and noise in the ears, and\nthe stench of the nostrils. The root itself,\neither green or in powder, helps to cleanse,\nheal, and incarnate wounds, and to cover\nthe naked bones with flesh again, that\nulcers have made bare; and is also very\ngood to cleanse and heal up fistulas and\ncankers that are hard to be cured.\nFLUELLIN, OR LLUELLIN.\nDescript.] It shoots forth many long\nbranches partly lying upon the ground,\nand partly standing upright, set with almost\nred leaves, yet a little pointed, and\nsometimes more long than round, without\norder thereon, somewhat hairy, and of an\nevil greenish white colour; at the joints all\nalong the stalks, and with the leaves come\nforth small flowers, one at a place, upon\na very small short foot-stalk, gaping somewhat\nlike Snap-dragons, or rather like Toad-flax,\nwith the upper jaw of a yellow colour,\nand the lower of a purplish, with a small heel\nor spur behind; after which come forth\nsmall round heads, containing small black\nseed. The root is small and thready, dying\nevery year, and rises itself again of its\nown sowing.\nThere is another sort of Lluellin which\nhas longer branches wholly trailing upon\nthe ground, two or three feet long, and\nsomewhat more thin, set with leaves thereon,\nupon small foot-stalks. The leaves are\na little larger, and somewhat round, and\ncornered sometimes in some places on the\nedges; but the lower part of them being\nthe broadest, hath on each side a small\npoint, making it seem as if they were ears,\nsometimes hairy, but not hoary, and of a\nbetter green colour than the former. The\nflowers come forth like the former, but the\ncolours therein are more white than yellow,\nand the purple not so far. It is a large\nflower, and so are the seed and seed-vessels.\nThe root is like the other, and\nperishes every year.\n[80]\nPlace.] They grow in divers corn fields,\nand in borders about them, and in other\nfertile grounds about Southfleet in Kent\nabundantly; at Buchrite, Hamerton, and\nRickmanworth in Huntingdonshire, and in\ndivers other places.\nTime.] They are in flower about June\nand July, and the whole plant is dry and\nwithered before August be done.\nGovernment and virtues.] It is a Lunar\nherb. The leaves bruised and applied with\nbarley meal to watering eyes that are hot\nand inflamed by defluxions from the head,\ndo very much help them, as also the fluxes\nof blood or humours, as the lask, bloody\nflux, women’s courses, and stays all manner\nof bleeding at the nose, mouth, or any\nother place, or that comes by any bruise\nor hurt, or bursting a vein; it wonderfully\nhelps all those inward parts that need consolidating\nor strengthening, and is no less\neffectual both to heal and close green\nwounds, than to cleanse and heal all foul\nor old ulcers, fretting or spreading cankers\nor the like. This herb is of a fine cooling,\ndrying quality, and an ointment or plaister\nof it might do a man a courtesy that hath\nany hot virulent sores: ’Tis admirable for\nthe ulcers of the French pox; if taken inwardly,\nmay cure the desease.\nFOX-GLOVE.\nDescript.] It has many long and broad\nleaves lying upon the ground dented upon\nthe edges, a little soft or woolly, and of a\nhoary green colour, among which rise up\nsometimes sundry stalks, but one very\noften, bearing such leaves thereon from the\nbottom to the middle, from whence to the\ntop it is stored with large and long hollow\nreddish purple flowers, a little more long\nand eminent at the lower edge, with some\nwhite spots within them, one above another\nwith small green leaves at every one, but\nall of them turning their heads one way,\nand hanging downwards, having some\nthreads also in the middle, from whence\nrise round heads, pointed sharp at the ends,\nwherein small brown seed lies. The roots\nare so many small fibres, and some greater\nstrings among them; the flowers have no\nscent, but the leaves have a bitter hot\ntaste.\nPlace.] It grows on dry sandy ground\nfor the most part, and as well on the higher\nas the lower places under hedge-sides in\nalmost every county of this land.\nTime.] It seldom flowers before July,\nand the seed is ripe in August.\nGovernment and virtues.] The plant is\nunder the dominion of Venus, being of a\ngentle cleansing nature, and withal very\nfriendly to nature. The herb is familiarly\nand frequently used by the Italians to heal\nany fresh or green wound, the leaves being\nbut bruised and bound thereon; and the\njuice thereof is also used in old sores, to\ncleanse, dry, and heal them. The decoction\nhereof made up with some sugar or\nhoney, is available to cleanse and purge\nthe body both upwards and downwards,\nsometimes of tough phlegm and clammy\nhumours, and to open obstructions of the\nliver and spleen. It has been found by\nexperience to be available for the king’s\nevil, the herb bruised and applied, or an\nointment made with the juice thereof, and\nso used; and a decoction of two handfuls\nthereof, with four ounces of Polipody in\nale, has been found by late experience to\ncure divers of the falling sickness, that have\nbeen troubled with it above twenty years.\nI am confident that an ointment of it is\none of the best remedies for scabby head\nthat is.",
    "full_text": "FENNEL.\nEvery garden affords this so plentifully,\nthat it needs no description.\nGovernment and virtues.] One good old\nfashion is not yet left off, viz. to boil Fennel\nwith fish; for it consumes that phlegmatic\nhumour, which fish most plentifully afford\nand annoy the body with, though few that\nuse it know wherefore they do it; I suppose\nthe reason of its benefit this way is because\nit is an herb of Mercury, and under Virgo,\nand therefore bears antipathy to Pisces.\nFennel is good to break wind, to provoke\nurine, and ease the pains of the stone, and\nhelps to break it. The leaves or seed,\nboiled in barley water and drank are good\nfor nurses, to increase their milk, and make\nit more wholesome for the child. The\nleaves, or rather the seeds, boiled in water,\nstays the hiccough, and takes away the\nloathings which oftentimes happen to the\nstomachs of sick and feverish persons and\nallays the heat thereof. The seed boiled in\nwine and drank, is good for those that are\nbitten with serpents, or have eaten poisonous\nherbs, or mushrooms. The seed and\nthe roots much more, help to open obstructions\nof the liver, spleen, and gall, and\nthereby help the painful and windy swellings\nof the spleen, and the yellow jaundice;\nas also the gout and cramps. The seed is\nof good use in medicines to help shortness\nof breath and wheezing by stopping of the\nlungs. It helps also to bring down the\ncourses, and to cleanse the parts after\ndelivery. The roots are of most use in\nphysic drinks, and broth that are taken to\ncleanse the blood, to open obstructions of\nthe liver, to provoke urine, and amend the\nill colour in the face after sickness, and to\ncause a good habit through the body.[74]\nBoth leaves, seeds, and roots thereof are\nmuch used in drink or broth, to make people\nmore lean that are too fat. The distilled\nwater of the whole herb, or the condensate\njuice dissolved, but especially the\nnatural juice, that in some counties issues\nout hereof of its own accord, dropped into\nthe eyes, cleanses them from mists and\nfilms that hinder the sight. The sweet\nFennel is much weaker in physical uses\nthan the common Fennel. The wild Fennel\nis stronger and hotter than the tame,\nand therefore most powerful against the\nstone, but not so effectual to encrease milk,\nbecause of its dryness.\nSOW-FENNEL, OR HOG’S-FENNEL.\nBesides the common name in English,\nHog’s Fennel, and the Latin name Peucidanum,\nis called Hoar-strange, and Hoar-strong,\nSulphur-wort, and Brimstone-wort.\nDescript.] The common Sow-Fennel\nhas divers branched stalks of thick and\nsomewhat long leaves, three for the most\npart joined together at a place, among\nwhich arises a crested straight stalk, less\nthan Fennel, with some joints thereon, and\nleaves growing thereat, and towards the\ntops some branches issuing from thence;\nlikewise on the tops of the stalks and\nbranches stand divers tufts of yellow flowers,\nwhereafter grows somewhat flat, thin, and\nyellowish seed, bigger than Fennel seed.\nThe roots grow great and deep, with many\nother parts and fibres about them of a\nstrong scent like hot brimstone, and yield\nforth a yellowish milk, or clammy juice,\nalmost like a gum.\nPlace.] It grows plentifully in the salt\nlow marshes near Feversham in Kent.\nTime.] It flowers plentifully in July and\nAugust.\nGovernment and virtues.] This is also an\nherb of Mercury. The juice of Sow-Fennel\n(saith Dioscorides, and Galen,) used with\nvinegar and rose water, or the juice with a\nlittle Euphorbium put to the nose, helps\nthose that are troubled with the lethargy,\nfrenzy, giddiness of the head, the falling\nsickness, long and inveterate head-aches,\nthe palsy, sciatica, and the cramp, and\ngenerally all the diseases of the sinews, used\nwith oil and vinegar. The juice dissolved\nin wine, or put into an egg, is good for a\ncough, or shortness of breath, and for those\nthat are troubled with wind in the body.\nIt purges the belly gently, expels the hardness\nof the spleen, gives ease to women\nthat have sore travail in child-birth, and\neases the pains of the reins and bladder,\nand also the womb. A little of the juice\ndissolved in wine, and dropped into the\nears, eases much of the pains in them, and\nput into a hollow tooth, eases the pain\nthereof. The root is less effectual to all\nthe aforesaid disorders; yet the powder of\nthe root cleanses foul ulcers, being put into\nthem, and takes out splinters of broken\nbones, or other things in the flesh, and\nheals them up perfectly: as also, dries up\nold and inveterate running sores, and is of\nadmirable virtue in all green wounds.\nFIG-WORT, OR THROAT-WORT.\nDescript.] Common great Fig-wort sends\ndivers great, strong, hard, square brown\nstalks, three or four feet high, whereon grow\nlarge, hard, and dark green leaves, two at\na joint, harder and larger than Nettle\nleaves, but not stinking; at the tops of the\nstalks stand many purple flowers set in\nhusks, which are sometimes gaping and\nopen, somewhat like those of Water Betony;\nafter which come hard round heads, with\na small point in the middle, wherein lie\nsmall brownish seed. The root is great,\nwhite, and thick, with many branches at it,\ngrowing aslope under the upper crust of\nthe ground, which abides many years, but\nkeeps not his green leaves in Winter.\nPlace.] It grows frequently in moist[75]\nand shadowy woods, and in the lower parts\nof the fields and meadows.\nTime.] It flowers about July, and the\nseed will be ripe about a month after the\nflowers are fallen.\nGovernment and virtues.] Some Latin\nauthors call it Cervicaria, because it is appropriated\nto the neck; and we Throat-wort,\nbecause it is appropriated to the\nthroat. Venus owns the herb, and the\nCelestial Bull will not deny it; therefore\na better remedy cannot be for the king’s\nevil, because the Moon that rules the disease,\nis exalted there. The decoction of the\nherb taken inwardly, and the bruised herb\napplied outwardly, dissolves clotted and\ncongealed blood within the body, coming\nby any wounds, bruise, or fall; and is no\nless effectual for the king’s evil, or any\nother knobs, kernel, bunches, or wens\ngrowing in the flesh wheresoever; and for\nthe hæmorrhoids, or piles. An ointment\nmade hereof may be used at all times when\nthe fresh herb is not to be had. The distilled\nwater of the whole plant, roots and\nall, is used for the same purposes, and dries\nup the superfluous, virulent moisture of\nhollow and corroding ulcers; it takes away\nall redness, spots, and freckles in the face,\nas also the scurf, and any foul deformity\ntherein, and the leprosy likewise.\nFILIPENDULA, OR DROP-WORT.\nDescript.] This sends forth many leaves,\nsome larger, some smaller, set on each side\nof a middle rib, and each of them dented\nabout the edges, somewhat resembling wild\nTansy, or rather Agrimony, but harder in\nhandling; among which rise up one or\nmore stalks, two or three feet high, with the\nleaves growing thereon, and sometimes also\ndivided into other branches spreading at the\ntop into many white, sweet-smelling flowers,\nconsisting of five leaves a-piece, with some\nthreads in the middle of them, standing\ntogether in a pith or umble, each upon a\nsmall foot stalk, which after they have been\nblown upon a good while, do fall away,\nand in their places appear small, round,\nchaffy heads like buttons, wherein are the\nchaffy seeds set and placed. The root\nconsists of many small, black, tuberous\npieces, fastened together by many small,\nlong, blackish strings, which run from one\nto another.\nPlace.] It grows in many places of this\nland, in the corners of dry fields and meadows,\nand the hedge sides.\nTime.] They flower in June and July,\nand their seed is ripe in August.\nGovernment and virtues.] It is under the\ndominion of Venus. It effectually opens\nthe passages of the urine, helps the stranguary;\nthe stone in the kidneys or bladder,\nthe gravel, and all other pains of the bladder\nand reins, by taking the roots in powder,\nor a decoction of them in white wine,\nwith a little honey. The roots made into\npowder, and mixed with honey in the form\nof an electuary, doth much help them\nwhose stomachs are swollen, dissolving and\nbreaking the wind which was the cause\nthereof; and is also very effectual for all\nthe diseases of the lungs, as shortness of\nbreath, wheezing, hoarseness of the throat,\nand the cough; and to expectorate tough\nphlegm, or any other parts thereabout.\nTHE FIG-TREE.\nTo give a description of a tree so well\nknown to every body that keep it in his\ngarden, were needless. They prosper very\nwell in our English gardens, yet are fitter\nfor medicine than for any other profit which\nis gotten by the fruit of them.\nGovernment and virtues.] The tree is\nunder the dominion of Jupiter. The milk\nthat issues out from the leaves or branches\nwhere they are broken off, being dropped\nupon warts, takes them away. The decoction[76]\nof the leaves is excellently good to\nwash sore heads with: and there is scarcely\na better remedy for the leprosy than it is.\nIt clears the face also of morphew, and the\nbody of white scurf, scabs, and running\nsores. If it be dropped into old fretting\nulcers, it cleanses out the moisture, and\nbrings up the flesh; because you cannot\nhave the leaves green all the year, you may\nmake an ointment of them whilst you can.\nA decoction of the leaves being drank inwardly,\nor rather a syrup made of them,\ndissolves congealed blood caused by bruises\nor falls, and helps the bloody flux. The\nashes of the wood made into an ointment\nwith hog’s grease, helps kibes and chilblains.\nThe juice being put into an hollow tooth,\neases pain: as also pain and noise in the\nears, being dropped into them; and deafness.\nAn ointment made of the juice and\nhog’s grease, is an excellent remedy for the\nbitten of mad dogs, or other venomous\nbeasts as most are. A syrup made of the\nleaves, or green fruit, is excellently good for\ncoughs, hoarseness, or shortness of breath,\nand all diseases of the breast and lungs; it\nis also extremely good for the dropsy and\nfalling sickness. They say that the Fig\nTree, as well as the Bay Tree, is never\nhurt by lightning; as also, if you tie a bull,\nbe he ever so mad, to a Fig Tree, he will\nquickly become tame and gentle. As for\nsuch figs as come from beyond sea, I\nhave little to say, because I write not of\nexoticks.\nTHE YELLOW WATER-FLAG, OR FLOWER-DE-LUCE.\nDescript.] This grows like the Flower-de-luce,\nbut it has much longer and narrower\nsad green leaves, joined together in\nthat fashion; the stalk also growing oftentimes\nas high, bearing small yellow flowers\nshaped like the Flower-de-luce, with three\nfalling leaves, and other three arched that\ncover their bottoms; but instead of the\nthree upright leaves, as the Flower-de-luce\nhas, this has only three short pieces standing\nin their places, after which succeed\nthick and long three square heads, containing\nin each part somewhat big and flat\nseed, like those of the Flower-de-luce. The\nroot is long and slender, of a pale brownish\ncolour on the outside, and of a horseflesh\ncolour on the inside, with many hard fibres\nthereat, and very harsh in taste.\nPlace.] It usually grows in watery\nditches, ponds, lakes, and moor sides, which\nare always overflowed with water.\nTime.] It flowers in July, and the seed\nis ripe in August.\nGovernment and virtues.] It is under the\ndominion of the Moon. The root of this\nWater-flag is very astringent, cooling, and\ndrying; and thereby helps all lasks and\nfluxes, whether of blood or humours, as\nbleeding at the mouth, nose, or other parts,\nbloody flux, and the immoderate flux of\nwomen’s courses. The distilled water of\nthe whole herb, flowers and roots, is a\nsovereign good remedy for watering eyes,\nboth to be dropped into them, and to have\ncloths or sponges wetted therein, and applied\nto the forehead: It also helps the\nspots and blemishes that happen in and\nabout the eyes, or in any other parts: The\nsaid water fomented on swellings and hot\ninflammations of women’s breasts, upon\ncancers also, and those spreading ulcers\ncalled Noli me tangere, do much good: It\nhelps also foul ulcers in the privities of man\nor woman; but an ointment made of the\nflowers is better for those external applications.\nFLAX-WEED, OR TOAD-FLAX.\nDescript.] Our common Flax-weed has\ndivers stalks full fraught with long and\nnarrow ash-coloured leaves, and from the\nmiddle of them almost upward, stored with[77]\na number of pale yellow flowers, of a strong\nunpleasant scent, with deeper yellow\nmouths, and blackish flat seed in round\nheads. The root is somewhat woody and\nwhite, especially the main downright one,\nwith many fibres, abiding many years,\nshooting forth roots every way round about,\nand new branches every year.\nPlace.] This grows throughout this land,\nboth by the way sides and in meadows, as\nalso by hedge-sides, and upon the sides of\nbanks, and borders of fields.\nTime.] It flowers in Summer, and the\nseed is ripe usually before the end of\nAugust.\nGovernment and virtues.] Mars owns the\nherb: In Sussex we call it Gallwort, and\nlay it in our chicken’s water to cure them\nof the gall; it relieves them when they are\ndrooping. This is frequently used to spend\nthe abundance of those watery humours by\nurine which cause the dropsy. The decoction\nof the herb, both leaves and flowers,\nin wine, taken and drank, doth somewhat\nmove the belly downwards, opens obstructions\nof the liver, and helps the yellow\njaundice; expels poison, provokes women’s\ncourses, drives forth the dead child, and\nafter-birth. The distilled water of the herb\nand flowers is effectual for all the same purposes;\nbeing drank with a dram of the\npowder of the seeds of bark or the roots of\nWall-wort, and a little Cinnamon, for certain\ndays together, it is held a singular remedy\nfor the dropsy. The juice of the herb,\nor the distilled water, dropped into the eyes,\nis a certain remedy for all heat, inflammation,\nand redness in them. The juice or\nwater put into foul ulcers, whether they be\ncancerous or fistulous, with tents rolled\ntherein, or parts washed and injected therewith,\ncleanses them thoroughly from the\nbottom, and heals them up safely. The\nsame juice or water also cleanses the skin\nwonderfully of all sorts of deformity, as\nleprosy, morphew, scurf, wheals, pimples,\nor spots, applied of itself, or used with some\npowder of Lupines.\nFLEA-WORT.\nDescript.] Ordinary Flea-wort rises\nup with a stalk two feet high or more, full\nof joints and branches on every side up to\nthe top, and at every joint two small, long\nand narrow whitish green leaves somewhat\nhairy. At the top of every branch stand\ndivers small, short scaly, or chaffy heads\nout of which come forth small whitish\nyellow threads, like to those of the Plantain\nherbs, which are the bloomings of\nflowers. The seed enclosed in these heads\nis small and shining while it is fresh, very\nlike unto fleas both for colour and bigness,\nbut turning black when it grows old. The\nroot is not long, but white, hard and woody,\nperishing every year, and rising again of\nits own seed for divers years, if it be suffered\nto shed: The whole plant is somewhat\nwhitish and hairy, smelling somewhat like\nrosin.\nThere is another sort hereof, differing not\nfrom the former in the manner of growing,\nbut only that the stalk and branches being\nsomewhat greater, do a little more bow\ndown to the ground: The leaves are somewhat\ngreater, the heads somewhat less, the\nseed alike; and the root and leaves abide\nall winter, and perish not as the former.\nPlace.] The first grows only in gardens,\nthe second plentifully in fields that are\nnear the sea.\nTime.] They flower in July or thereabouts.\nGovernment and virtues.] The herb is\ncold, and dry, and saturnine. I suppose\nit obtained the name of Flea-wort, because\nthe seeds are so like Fleas. The seeds fried,\nand taken, stays the flux or lask of the\nbelly, and the corrosions that come by reason\nof hot choleric, or sharp and malignant\nhumours, or by too much purging of any\nviolent medicine, as Scammony, or the[78]\nlike. The mucilage of the seed made with\nRose-water, and a little sugar-candy put\nthereto, is very good in all hot agues and\nburning fevers, and other inflammations, to\ncool the thirst, and lenify the dryness and\nroughness of the tongue and throat. It\nhelps also hoarseness of the voice, and diseases\nof the breast and lungs, caused by\nheat, or sharp salt humours, and the pleurisy\nalso. The mucilage of the seed made\nwith Plantain water, whereunto the yoke of\nan egg or two, and a little Populeon are\nput, is a most safe and sure remedy to ease\nthe sharpness, pricking, and pains of the\nhæmorrhoids or piles, if it be laid on a\ncloth, and bound thereto. It helps all inflammations\nin any part of the body, and\nthe pains that come thereby, as the headache\nand megrims, and all hot imposthumes,\nswellings, or breaking out of the skin, as\nblains, wheals, pushes, purples, and the\nlike, as also the joints of those that are out\nof joint, the pains of the gout and sciatica,\nthe burstings of young children, and the\nswellings of the navel, applied with oil of\nroses and vinegar. It is also good to heal\nthe nipples and sore breasts of women,\nbeing often applied thereunto. The juice\nof the herb with a little honey put into the\nears helps the running of them, and the\nworms breeding in them: The same also\nmixed with hog’s grease, and applied to\ncorrupt and filthy ulcers, cleanses them\nand heals them.\nFLUX-WEED.\nDescript.] It rises up with a round\nupright hard stalk, four or five feet high,\nspread into sundry branches, whereon grow\nmany greyish green leaves, very finely cut\nand severed into a number of short and\nalmost round parts. The flowers are very\nsmall and yellow, growing spike fashion,\nafter which come small long pods, with\nsmall yellowish seed in them. The root is\nlong and woody, perishing every year.\nThere is another sort, differing in nothing,\nsave only it has somewhat broad leaves;\nthey have a strong evil saviour, being\nsmelled unto, and are of a drying taste.\nPlace.] They flower wild in the fields\nby hedge-sides and highways, and among\nrubbish and other places.\nTime.] They flower and seed quickly\nafter, namely in June and July.\nGovernment and virtues.] This herb is\nsaturnine also. Both the herb and seed of\nFlux-weed is of excellent use to stay the flux\nor lask of the belly, being drank in water\nwherein gads of steel heated have been\noften quenched; and is no less effectual\nfor the same purpose than Plantain or Comfrey,\nand to restrain any other flux of blood\nin man or woman, as also to consoladate\nbones broken or out of joint. The juice\nthereof drank in wine, or the decoction of\nthe herb drank, doth kill the worms in the\nstomach or belly, or the worms that grow\nin putrid and filthy ulcers, and made into\na salve doth quickly heal all old sores, how\nfoul or malignant soever they be. The\ndistilled water of the herb works the same\neffect, although somewhat weaker, yet it\nis a fair medicine, and more acceptable to\nbe taken. It is called Flux-weed because\nit cures the flux, and for its uniting broken\nbones, &c. Paracelsus extols it to the skies.\nIt is fitting that syrup, ointment, and\nplaisters of it were kept in your house.\nFLOWER-DE-LUCE.\nIt is so well known, being nourished up\nin most gardens, that I shall not need to\nspent time in writing a description thereof.\nTime.] The flaggy kinds thereof have\nthe most physical uses; the dwarf kinds\nthereof flowers in April, the greater sorts\nin May.\nGovernment and virtues.] The herb is\nLuner. The juice or decoction of the green\nroot of the flaggy kind of Flower-de-luce,\nwith a little honey drank, doth purge and[79]\ncleanse the stomach of gross and tough\nphlegm, and choler therein; it helps the\njaundice and the dropsy, evacuating those\nhumours both upwards and downwards;\nand because it somewhat hurts the stomach,\nis not to be taken without honey and spikenard.\nThe same being drank, doth ease\nthe pains and torments of the belly and\nsides, the shaking of agues, the diseases of\nthe liver and spleen, the worms of the belly,\nthe stone in the reins, convulsions and\ncramps that come of old humours; it also\nhelps those whose seed passes from them\nunawares: It is a remedy against the\nbitings and stingings of venomous creatures,\nbeing boiled in water and vinegar\nand drank. Boiled in water and drank, it\nprovokes urine, helps the cholic, brings\ndown women’s courses; and made up into\na pessary with honey, and put up into the\nbody, draws forth the dead child. It is\nmuch commended against the cough, to\nexpectorate rough phlegm. It much eases\npains in the head, and procures sleep;\nbeing put into the nostrils it procures\nsneezing, and thereby purges the head of\nphlegm. The juice of the root applied to\nthe piles or hæmorrhoids, gives much ease.\nThe decoction of the roots gargled in the\nmouth, eases the tooth-ache, and helps the\nstinking breath. Oil called Oleum Irinum,\nif it be rightly made of the great broad\nflag Flower-de-luce and not of the great\nbulbous blue Flower-de-luce, (as is used by\nsome apothecaries) and roots of the same, of\nthe flaggy kinds, is very effectual to warm\nand comfort all cold joints and sinews, as\nalso the gout and sciatica, and mollifies,\ndissolves and consumes tumours and swellings\nin any part of the body, as also of the\nmatrix; it helps the cramp, or convulsions\nof the sinews. The head and temples\nanointed therewith, helps the catarrh or\nthin rheum distilled from thence; and used\nupon the breast or stomach, helps to extenuate\nthe cold tough phlegm; it helps\nalso the pains and noise in the ears, and\nthe stench of the nostrils. The root itself,\neither green or in powder, helps to cleanse,\nheal, and incarnate wounds, and to cover\nthe naked bones with flesh again, that\nulcers have made bare; and is also very\ngood to cleanse and heal up fistulas and\ncankers that are hard to be cured.\nFLUELLIN, OR LLUELLIN.\nDescript.] It shoots forth many long\nbranches partly lying upon the ground,\nand partly standing upright, set with almost\nred leaves, yet a little pointed, and\nsometimes more long than round, without\norder thereon, somewhat hairy, and of an\nevil greenish white colour; at the joints all\nalong the stalks, and with the leaves come\nforth small flowers, one at a place, upon\na very small short foot-stalk, gaping somewhat\nlike Snap-dragons, or rather like Toad-flax,\nwith the upper jaw of a yellow colour,\nand the lower of a purplish, with a small heel\nor spur behind; after which come forth\nsmall round heads, containing small black\nseed. The root is small and thready, dying\nevery year, and rises itself again of its\nown sowing.\nThere is another sort of Lluellin which\nhas longer branches wholly trailing upon\nthe ground, two or three feet long, and\nsomewhat more thin, set with leaves thereon,\nupon small foot-stalks. The leaves are\na little larger, and somewhat round, and\ncornered sometimes in some places on the\nedges; but the lower part of them being\nthe broadest, hath on each side a small\npoint, making it seem as if they were ears,\nsometimes hairy, but not hoary, and of a\nbetter green colour than the former. The\nflowers come forth like the former, but the\ncolours therein are more white than yellow,\nand the purple not so far. It is a large\nflower, and so are the seed and seed-vessels.\nThe root is like the other, and\nperishes every year.\n[80]\nPlace.] They grow in divers corn fields,\nand in borders about them, and in other\nfertile grounds about Southfleet in Kent\nabundantly; at Buchrite, Hamerton, and\nRickmanworth in Huntingdonshire, and in\ndivers other places.\nTime.] They are in flower about June\nand July, and the whole plant is dry and\nwithered before August be done.\nGovernment and virtues.] It is a Lunar\nherb. The leaves bruised and applied with\nbarley meal to watering eyes that are hot\nand inflamed by defluxions from the head,\ndo very much help them, as also the fluxes\nof blood or humours, as the lask, bloody\nflux, women’s courses, and stays all manner\nof bleeding at the nose, mouth, or any\nother place, or that comes by any bruise\nor hurt, or bursting a vein; it wonderfully\nhelps all those inward parts that need consolidating\nor strengthening, and is no less\neffectual both to heal and close green\nwounds, than to cleanse and heal all foul\nor old ulcers, fretting or spreading cankers\nor the like. This herb is of a fine cooling,\ndrying quality, and an ointment or plaister\nof it might do a man a courtesy that hath\nany hot virulent sores: ’Tis admirable for\nthe ulcers of the French pox; if taken inwardly,\nmay cure the desease.\nFOX-GLOVE.\nDescript.] It has many long and broad\nleaves lying upon the ground dented upon\nthe edges, a little soft or woolly, and of a\nhoary green colour, among which rise up\nsometimes sundry stalks, but one very\noften, bearing such leaves thereon from the\nbottom to the middle, from whence to the\ntop it is stored with large and long hollow\nreddish purple flowers, a little more long\nand eminent at the lower edge, with some\nwhite spots within them, one above another\nwith small green leaves at every one, but\nall of them turning their heads one way,\nand hanging downwards, having some\nthreads also in the middle, from whence\nrise round heads, pointed sharp at the ends,\nwherein small brown seed lies. The roots\nare so many small fibres, and some greater\nstrings among them; the flowers have no\nscent, but the leaves have a bitter hot\ntaste.\nPlace.] It grows on dry sandy ground\nfor the most part, and as well on the higher\nas the lower places under hedge-sides in\nalmost every county of this land.\nTime.] It seldom flowers before July,\nand the seed is ripe in August.\nGovernment and virtues.] The plant is\nunder the dominion of Venus, being of a\ngentle cleansing nature, and withal very\nfriendly to nature. The herb is familiarly\nand frequently used by the Italians to heal\nany fresh or green wound, the leaves being\nbut bruised and bound thereon; and the\njuice thereof is also used in old sores, to\ncleanse, dry, and heal them. The decoction\nhereof made up with some sugar or\nhoney, is available to cleanse and purge\nthe body both upwards and downwards,\nsometimes of tough phlegm and clammy\nhumours, and to open obstructions of the\nliver and spleen. It has been found by\nexperience to be available for the king’s\nevil, the herb bruised and applied, or an\nointment made with the juice thereof, and\nso used; and a decoction of two handfuls\nthereof, with four ounces of Polipody in\nale, has been found by late experience to\ncure divers of the falling sickness, that have\nbeen troubled with it above twenty years.\nI am confident that an ointment of it is\none of the best remedies for scabby head\nthat is.\n",
    "cleaned_text": "FENNEL.\nEvery garden affords this so plentifully,\nthat it needs no description.\nGovernment and virtues.] One good old\nfashion is not yet left off, viz. to boil Fennel\nwith fish; for it consumes that phlegmatic\nhumour, which fish most plentifully afford\nand annoy the body with, though few that\nuse it know wherefore they do it; I suppose\nthe reason of its benefit this way is because\nit is an herb of Mercury, and under Virgo,\nand therefore bears antipathy to Pisces.\nFennel is good to break wind, to provoke\nurine, and ease the pains of the stone, and\nhelps to break it. The leaves or seed,\nboiled in barley water and drank are good\nfor nurses, to increase their milk, and make\nit more wholesome for the child. The\nleaves, or rather the seeds, boiled in water,\nstays the hiccough, and takes away the\nloathings which oftentimes happen to the\nstomachs of sick and feverish persons and\nallays the heat thereof. The seed boiled in\nwine and drank, is good for those that are\nbitten with serpents, or have eaten poisonous\nherbs, or mushrooms. The seed and\nthe roots much more, help to open obstructions\nof the liver, spleen, and gall, and\nthereby help the painful and windy swellings\nof the spleen, and the yellow jaundice;\nas also the gout and cramps. The seed is\nof good use in medicines to help shortness\nof breath and wheezing by stopping of the\nlungs. It helps also to bring down the\ncourses, and to cleanse the parts after\ndelivery. The roots are of most use in\nphysic drinks, and broth that are taken to\ncleanse the blood, to open obstructions of\nthe liver, to provoke urine, and amend the\nill colour in the face after sickness, and to\ncause a good habit through the body.[74]\nBoth leaves, seeds, and roots thereof are\nmuch used in drink or broth, to make people\nmore lean that are too fat. The distilled\nwater of the whole herb, or the condensate\njuice dissolved, but especially the\nnatural juice, that in some counties issues\nout hereof of its own accord, dropped into\nthe eyes, cleanses them from mists and\nfilms that hinder the sight. The sweet\nFennel is much weaker in physical uses\nthan the common Fennel. The wild Fennel\nis stronger and hotter than the tame,\nand therefore most powerful against the\nstone, but not so effectual to encrease milk,\nbecause of its dryness.\nSOW-FENNEL, OR HOG’S-FENNEL.\nBesides the common name in English,\nHog’s Fennel, and the Latin name Peucidanum,\nis called Hoar-strange, and Hoar-strong,\nSulphur-wort, and Brimstone-wort.\nDescript.] The common Sow-Fennel\nhas divers branched stalks of thick and\nsomewhat long leaves, three for the most\npart joined together at a place, among\nwhich arises a crested straight stalk, less\nthan Fennel, with some joints thereon, and\nleaves growing thereat, and towards the\ntops some branches issuing from thence;\nlikewise on the tops of the stalks and\nbranches stand divers tufts of yellow flowers,\nwhereafter grows somewhat flat, thin, and\nyellowish seed, bigger than Fennel seed.\nThe roots grow great and deep, with many\nother parts and fibres about them of a\nstrong scent like hot brimstone, and yield\nforth a yellowish milk, or clammy juice,\nalmost like a gum.\nPlace.] It grows plentifully in the salt\nlow marshes near Feversham in Kent.\nTime.] It flowers plentifully in July and\nAugust.\nGovernment and virtues.] This is also an\nherb of Mercury. The juice of Sow-Fennel\n(saith Dioscorides, and Galen,) used with\nvinegar and rose water, or the juice with a\nlittle Euphorbium put to the nose, helps\nthose that are troubled with the lethargy,\nfrenzy, giddiness of the head, the falling\nsickness, long and inveterate head-aches,\nthe palsy, sciatica, and the cramp, and\ngenerally all the diseases of the sinews, used\nwith oil and vinegar. The juice dissolved\nin wine, or put into an egg, is good for a\ncough, or shortness of breath, and for those\nthat are troubled with wind in the body.\nIt purges the belly gently, expels the hardness\nof the spleen, gives ease to women\nthat have sore travail in child-birth, and\neases the pains of the reins and bladder,\nand also the womb. A little of the juice\ndissolved in wine, and dropped into the\nears, eases much of the pains in them, and\nput into a hollow tooth, eases the pain\nthereof. The root is less effectual to all\nthe aforesaid disorders; yet the powder of\nthe root cleanses foul ulcers, being put into\nthem, and takes out splinters of broken\nbones, or other things in the flesh, and\nheals them up perfectly: as also, dries up\nold and inveterate running sores, and is of\nadmirable virtue in all green wounds.\nFIG-WORT, OR THROAT-WORT.\nDescript.] Common great Fig-wort sends\ndivers great, strong, hard, square brown\nstalks, three or four feet high, whereon grow\nlarge, hard, and dark green leaves, two at\na joint, harder and larger than Nettle\nleaves, but not stinking; at the tops of the\nstalks stand many purple flowers set in\nhusks, which are sometimes gaping and\nopen, somewhat like those of Water Betony;\nafter which come hard round heads, with\na small point in the middle, wherein lie\nsmall brownish seed. The root is great,\nwhite, and thick, with many branches at it,\ngrowing aslope under the upper crust of\nthe ground, which abides many years, but\nkeeps not his green leaves in Winter.\nPlace.] It grows frequently in moist[75]\nand shadowy woods, and in the lower parts\nof the fields and meadows.\nTime.] It flowers about July, and the\nseed will be ripe about a month after the\nflowers are fallen.\nGovernment and virtues.] Some Latin\nauthors call it Cervicaria, because it is appropriated\nto the neck; and we Throat-wort,\nbecause it is appropriated to the\nthroat. Venus owns the herb, and the\nCelestial Bull will not deny it; therefore\na better remedy cannot be for the king’s\nevil, because the Moon that rules the disease,\nis exalted there. The decoction of the\nherb taken inwardly, and the bruised herb\napplied outwardly, dissolves clotted and\ncongealed blood within the body, coming\nby any wounds, bruise, or fall; and is no\nless effectual for the king’s evil, or any\nother knobs, kernel, bunches, or wens\ngrowing in the flesh wheresoever; and for\nthe hæmorrhoids, or piles. An ointment\nmade hereof may be used at all times when\nthe fresh herb is not to be had. The distilled\nwater of the whole plant, roots and\nall, is used for the same purposes, and dries\nup the superfluous, virulent moisture of\nhollow and corroding ulcers; it takes away\nall redness, spots, and freckles in the face,\nas also the scurf, and any foul deformity\ntherein, and the leprosy likewise.\nFILIPENDULA, OR DROP-WORT.\nDescript.] This sends forth many leaves,\nsome larger, some smaller, set on each side\nof a middle rib, and each of them dented\nabout the edges, somewhat resembling wild\nTansy, or rather Agrimony, but harder in\nhandling; among which rise up one or\nmore stalks, two or three feet high, with the\nleaves growing thereon, and sometimes also\ndivided into other branches spreading at the\ntop into many white, sweet-smelling flowers,\nconsisting of five leaves a-piece, with some\nthreads in the middle of them, standing\ntogether in a pith or umble, each upon a\nsmall foot stalk, which after they have been\nblown upon a good while, do fall away,\nand in their places appear small, round,\nchaffy heads like buttons, wherein are the\nchaffy seeds set and placed. The root\nconsists of many small, black, tuberous\npieces, fastened together by many small,\nlong, blackish strings, which run from one\nto another.\nPlace.] It grows in many places of this\nland, in the corners of dry fields and meadows,\nand the hedge sides.\nTime.] They flower in June and July,\nand their seed is ripe in August.\nGovernment and virtues.] It is under the\ndominion of Venus. It effectually opens\nthe passages of the urine, helps the stranguary;\nthe stone in the kidneys or bladder,\nthe gravel, and all other pains of the bladder\nand reins, by taking the roots in powder,\nor a decoction of them in white wine,\nwith a little honey. The roots made into\npowder, and mixed with honey in the form\nof an electuary, doth much help them\nwhose stomachs are swollen, dissolving and\nbreaking the wind which was the cause\nthereof; and is also very effectual for all\nthe diseases of the lungs, as shortness of\nbreath, wheezing, hoarseness of the throat,\nand the cough; and to expectorate tough\nphlegm, or any other parts thereabout.\nTHE FIG-TREE.\nTo give a description of a tree so well\nknown to every body that keep it in his\ngarden, were needless. They prosper very\nwell in our English gardens, yet are fitter\nfor medicine than for any other profit which\nis gotten by the fruit of them.\nGovernment and virtues.] The tree is\nunder the dominion of Jupiter. The milk\nthat issues out from the leaves or branches\nwhere they are broken off, being dropped\nupon warts, takes them away. The decoction[76]\nof the leaves is excellently good to\nwash sore heads with: and there is scarcely\na better remedy for the leprosy than it is.\nIt clears the face also of morphew, and the\nbody of white scurf, scabs, and running\nsores. If it be dropped into old fretting\nulcers, it cleanses out the moisture, and\nbrings up the flesh; because you cannot\nhave the leaves green all the year, you may\nmake an ointment of them whilst you can.\nA decoction of the leaves being drank inwardly,\nor rather a syrup made of them,\ndissolves congealed blood caused by bruises\nor falls, and helps the bloody flux. The\nashes of the wood made into an ointment\nwith hog’s grease, helps kibes and chilblains.\nThe juice being put into an hollow tooth,\neases pain: as also pain and noise in the\nears, being dropped into them; and deafness.\nAn ointment made of the juice and\nhog’s grease, is an excellent remedy for the\nbitten of mad dogs, or other venomous\nbeasts as most are. A syrup made of the\nleaves, or green fruit, is excellently good for\ncoughs, hoarseness, or shortness of breath,\nand all diseases of the breast and lungs; it\nis also extremely good for the dropsy and\nfalling sickness. They say that the Fig\nTree, as well as the Bay Tree, is never\nhurt by lightning; as also, if you tie a bull,\nbe he ever so mad, to a Fig Tree, he will\nquickly become tame and gentle. As for\nsuch figs as come from beyond sea, I\nhave little to say, because I write not of\nexoticks.\nTHE YELLOW WATER-FLAG, OR FLOWER-DE-LUCE.\nDescript.] This grows like the Flower-de-luce,\nbut it has much longer and narrower\nsad green leaves, joined together in\nthat fashion; the stalk also growing oftentimes\nas high, bearing small yellow flowers\nshaped like the Flower-de-luce, with three\nfalling leaves, and other three arched that\ncover their bottoms; but instead of the\nthree upright leaves, as the Flower-de-luce\nhas, this has only three short pieces standing\nin their places, after which succeed\nthick and long three square heads, containing\nin each part somewhat big and flat\nseed, like those of the Flower-de-luce. The\nroot is long and slender, of a pale brownish\ncolour on the outside, and of a horseflesh\ncolour on the inside, with many hard fibres\nthereat, and very harsh in taste.\nPlace.] It usually grows in watery\nditches, ponds, lakes, and moor sides, which\nare always overflowed with water.\nTime.] It flowers in July, and the seed\nis ripe in August.\nGovernment and virtues.] It is under the\ndominion of the Moon. The root of this\nWater-flag is very astringent, cooling, and\ndrying; and thereby helps all lasks and\nfluxes, whether of blood or humours, as\nbleeding at the mouth, nose, or other parts,\nbloody flux, and the immoderate flux of\nwomen’s courses. The distilled water of\nthe whole herb, flowers and roots, is a\nsovereign good remedy for watering eyes,\nboth to be dropped into them, and to have\ncloths or sponges wetted therein, and applied\nto the forehead: It also helps the\nspots and blemishes that happen in and\nabout the eyes, or in any other parts: The\nsaid water fomented on swellings and hot\ninflammations of women’s breasts, upon\ncancers also, and those spreading ulcers\ncalled Noli me tangere, do much good: It\nhelps also foul ulcers in the privities of man\nor woman; but an ointment made of the\nflowers is better for those external applications.\nFLAX-WEED, OR TOAD-FLAX.\nDescript.] Our common Flax-weed has\ndivers stalks full fraught with long and\nnarrow ash-coloured leaves, and from the\nmiddle of them almost upward, stored with[77]\na number of pale yellow flowers, of a strong\nunpleasant scent, with deeper yellow\nmouths, and blackish flat seed in round\nheads. The root is somewhat woody and\nwhite, especially the main downright one,\nwith many fibres, abiding many years,\nshooting forth roots every way round about,\nand new branches every year.\nPlace.] This grows throughout this land,\nboth by the way sides and in meadows, as\nalso by hedge-sides, and upon the sides of\nbanks, and borders of fields.\nTime.] It flowers in Summer, and the\nseed is ripe usually before the end of\nAugust.\nGovernment and virtues.] Mars owns the\nherb: In Sussex we call it Gallwort, and\nlay it in our chicken’s water to cure them\nof the gall; it relieves them when they are\ndrooping. This is frequently used to spend\nthe abundance of those watery humours by\nurine which cause the dropsy. The decoction\nof the herb, both leaves and flowers,\nin wine, taken and drank, doth somewhat\nmove the belly downwards, opens obstructions\nof the liver, and helps the yellow\njaundice; expels poison, provokes women’s\ncourses, drives forth the dead child, and\nafter-birth. The distilled water of the herb\nand flowers is effectual for all the same purposes;\nbeing drank with a dram of the\npowder of the seeds of bark or the roots of\nWall-wort, and a little Cinnamon, for certain\ndays together, it is held a singular remedy\nfor the dropsy. The juice of the herb,\nor the distilled water, dropped into the eyes,\nis a certain remedy for all heat, inflammation,\nand redness in them. The juice or\nwater put into foul ulcers, whether they be\ncancerous or fistulous, with tents rolled\ntherein, or parts washed and injected therewith,\ncleanses them thoroughly from the\nbottom, and heals them up safely. The\nsame juice or water also cleanses the skin\nwonderfully of all sorts of deformity, as\nleprosy, morphew, scurf, wheals, pimples,\nor spots, applied of itself, or used with some\npowder of Lupines.\nFLEA-WORT.\nDescript.] Ordinary Flea-wort rises\nup with a stalk two feet high or more, full\nof joints and branches on every side up to\nthe top, and at every joint two small, long\nand narrow whitish green leaves somewhat\nhairy. At the top of every branch stand\ndivers small, short scaly, or chaffy heads\nout of which come forth small whitish\nyellow threads, like to those of the Plantain\nherbs, which are the bloomings of\nflowers. The seed enclosed in these heads\nis small and shining while it is fresh, very\nlike unto fleas both for colour and bigness,\nbut turning black when it grows old. The\nroot is not long, but white, hard and woody,\nperishing every year, and rising again of\nits own seed for divers years, if it be suffered\nto shed: The whole plant is somewhat\nwhitish and hairy, smelling somewhat like\nrosin.\nThere is another sort hereof, differing not\nfrom the former in the manner of growing,\nbut only that the stalk and branches being\nsomewhat greater, do a little more bow\ndown to the ground: The leaves are somewhat\ngreater, the heads somewhat less, the\nseed alike; and the root and leaves abide\nall winter, and perish not as the former.\nPlace.] The first grows only in gardens,\nthe second plentifully in fields that are\nnear the sea.\nTime.] They flower in July or thereabouts.\nGovernment and virtues.] The herb is\ncold, and dry, and saturnine. I suppose\nit obtained the name of Flea-wort, because\nthe seeds are so like Fleas. The seeds fried,\nand taken, stays the flux or lask of the\nbelly, and the corrosions that come by reason\nof hot choleric, or sharp and malignant\nhumours, or by too much purging of any\nviolent medicine, as Scammony, or the[78]\nlike. The mucilage of the seed made with\nRose-water, and a little sugar-candy put\nthereto, is very good in all hot agues and\nburning fevers, and other inflammations, to\ncool the thirst, and lenify the dryness and\nroughness of the tongue and throat. It\nhelps also hoarseness of the voice, and diseases\nof the breast and lungs, caused by\nheat, or sharp salt humours, and the pleurisy\nalso. The mucilage of the seed made\nwith Plantain water, whereunto the yoke of\nan egg or two, and a little Populeon are\nput, is a most safe and sure remedy to ease\nthe sharpness, pricking, and pains of the\nhæmorrhoids or piles, if it be laid on a\ncloth, and bound thereto. It helps all inflammations\nin any part of the body, and\nthe pains that come thereby, as the headache\nand megrims, and all hot imposthumes,\nswellings, or breaking out of the skin, as\nblains, wheals, pushes, purples, and the\nlike, as also the joints of those that are out\nof joint, the pains of the gout and sciatica,\nthe burstings of young children, and the\nswellings of the navel, applied with oil of\nroses and vinegar. It is also good to heal\nthe nipples and sore breasts of women,\nbeing often applied thereunto. The juice\nof the herb with a little honey put into the\nears helps the running of them, and the\nworms breeding in them: The same also\nmixed with hog’s grease, and applied to\ncorrupt and filthy ulcers, cleanses them\nand heals them.\nFLUX-WEED.\nDescript.] It rises up with a round\nupright hard stalk, four or five feet high,\nspread into sundry branches, whereon grow\nmany greyish green leaves, very finely cut\nand severed into a number of short and\nalmost round parts. The flowers are very\nsmall and yellow, growing spike fashion,\nafter which come small long pods, with\nsmall yellowish seed in them. The root is\nlong and woody, perishing every year.\nThere is another sort, differing in nothing,\nsave only it has somewhat broad leaves;\nthey have a strong evil saviour, being\nsmelled unto, and are of a drying taste.\nPlace.] They flower wild in the fields\nby hedge-sides and highways, and among\nrubbish and other places.\nTime.] They flower and seed quickly\nafter, namely in June and July.\nGovernment and virtues.] This herb is\nsaturnine also. Both the herb and seed of\nFlux-weed is of excellent use to stay the flux\nor lask of the belly, being drank in water\nwherein gads of steel heated have been\noften quenched; and is no less effectual\nfor the same purpose than Plantain or Comfrey,\nand to restrain any other flux of blood\nin man or woman, as also to consoladate\nbones broken or out of joint. The juice\nthereof drank in wine, or the decoction of\nthe herb drank, doth kill the worms in the\nstomach or belly, or the worms that grow\nin putrid and filthy ulcers, and made into\na salve doth quickly heal all old sores, how\nfoul or malignant soever they be. The\ndistilled water of the herb works the same\neffect, although somewhat weaker, yet it\nis a fair medicine, and more acceptable to\nbe taken. It is called Flux-weed because\nit cures the flux, and for its uniting broken\nbones, &c. Paracelsus extols it to the skies.\nIt is fitting that syrup, ointment, and\nplaisters of it were kept in your house.\nFLOWER-DE-LUCE.\nIt is so well known, being nourished up\nin most gardens, that I shall not need to\nspent time in writing a description thereof.\nTime.] The flaggy kinds thereof have\nthe most physical uses; the dwarf kinds\nthereof flowers in April, the greater sorts\nin May.\nGovernment and virtues.] The herb is\nLuner. The juice or decoction of the green\nroot of the flaggy kind of Flower-de-luce,\nwith a little honey drank, doth purge and[79]\ncleanse the stomach of gross and tough\nphlegm, and choler therein; it helps the\njaundice and the dropsy, evacuating those\nhumours both upwards and downwards;\nand because it somewhat hurts the stomach,\nis not to be taken without honey and spikenard.\nThe same being drank, doth ease\nthe pains and torments of the belly and\nsides, the shaking of agues, the diseases of\nthe liver and spleen, the worms of the belly,\nthe stone in the reins, convulsions and\ncramps that come of old humours; it also\nhelps those whose seed passes from them\nunawares: It is a remedy against the\nbitings and stingings of venomous creatures,\nbeing boiled in water and vinegar\nand drank. Boiled in water and drank, it\nprovokes urine, helps the cholic, brings\ndown women’s courses; and made up into\na pessary with honey, and put up into the\nbody, draws forth the dead child. It is\nmuch commended against the cough, to\nexpectorate rough phlegm. It much eases\npains in the head, and procures sleep;\nbeing put into the nostrils it procures\nsneezing, and thereby purges the head of\nphlegm. The juice of the root applied to\nthe piles or hæmorrhoids, gives much ease.\nThe decoction of the roots gargled in the\nmouth, eases the tooth-ache, and helps the\nstinking breath. Oil called Oleum Irinum,\nif it be rightly made of the great broad\nflag Flower-de-luce and not of the great\nbulbous blue Flower-de-luce, (as is used by\nsome apothecaries) and roots of the same, of\nthe flaggy kinds, is very effectual to warm\nand comfort all cold joints and sinews, as\nalso the gout and sciatica, and mollifies,\ndissolves and consumes tumours and swellings\nin any part of the body, as also of the\nmatrix; it helps the cramp, or convulsions\nof the sinews. The head and temples\nanointed therewith, helps the catarrh or\nthin rheum distilled from thence; and used\nupon the breast or stomach, helps to extenuate\nthe cold tough phlegm; it helps\nalso the pains and noise in the ears, and\nthe stench of the nostrils. The root itself,\neither green or in powder, helps to cleanse,\nheal, and incarnate wounds, and to cover\nthe naked bones with flesh again, that\nulcers have made bare; and is also very\ngood to cleanse and heal up fistulas and\ncankers that are hard to be cured.\nFLUELLIN, OR LLUELLIN.\nDescript.] It shoots forth many long\nbranches partly lying upon the ground,\nand partly standing upright, set with almost\nred leaves, yet a little pointed, and\nsometimes more long than round, without\norder thereon, somewhat hairy, and of an\nevil greenish white colour; at the joints all\nalong the stalks, and with the leaves come\nforth small flowers, one at a place, upon\na very small short foot-stalk, gaping somewhat\nlike Snap-dragons, or rather like Toad-flax,\nwith the upper jaw of a yellow colour,\nand the lower of a purplish, with a small heel\nor spur behind; after which come forth\nsmall round heads, containing small black\nseed. The root is small and thready, dying\nevery year, and rises itself again of its\nown sowing.\nThere is another sort of Lluellin which\nhas longer branches wholly trailing upon\nthe ground, two or three feet long, and\nsomewhat more thin, set with leaves thereon,\nupon small foot-stalks. The leaves are\na little larger, and somewhat round, and\ncornered sometimes in some places on the\nedges; but the lower part of them being\nthe broadest, hath on each side a small\npoint, making it seem as if they were ears,\nsometimes hairy, but not hoary, and of a\nbetter green colour than the former. The\nflowers come forth like the former, but the\ncolours therein are more white than yellow,\nand the purple not so far.

The leaves bruised and applied with\nbarley meal to watering eyes that are hot\nand inflamed by defluxions from the head,\ndo very much help them, as also the fluxes\nof blood or humours, as the lask, bloody\nflux, women’s courses, and stays all manner\nof bleeding at the nose, mouth, or any\nother place, or that comes by any bruise\nor hurt, or bursting a vein; it wonderfully\nhelps all those inward parts that need consolidating\nor strengthening, and is no less\neffectual both to heal and close green\nwounds, than to cleanse and heal all foul\nor old ulcers, fretting or spreading cankers\nor the like. This herb is of a fine cooling,\ndrying quality, and an ointment or plaister\nof it might do a man a courtesy that hath\nany hot virulent sores: ’Tis admirable for\nthe ulcers of the French pox; if taken inwardly,\nmay cure the desease.\nFOX-GLOVE.\nDescript.] It has many long and broad\nleaves lying upon the ground dented upon\nthe edges, a little soft or woolly, and of a\nhoary green colour, among which rise up\nsometimes sundry stalks, but one very\noften, bearing such leaves thereon from the\nbottom to the middle, from whence to the\ntop it is stored with large and long hollow\nreddish purple flowers, a little more long\nand eminent at the lower edge, with some\nwhite spots within them, one above another\nwith small green leaves at every one, but\nall of them turning their heads one way,\nand hanging downwards, having some\nthreads also in the middle, from whence\nrise round heads, pointed sharp at the ends,\nwherein small brown seed lies. The roots\nare so many small fibres, and some greater\nstrings among them; the flowers have no\nscent, but the leaves have a bitter hot\ntaste.\nPlace.] It grows on dry sandy ground\nfor the most part, and as well on the higher\nas the lower places under hedge-sides in\nalmost every county of this land.\nTime.] It seldom flowers before July,\nand the seed is ripe in August.\nGovernment and virtues.] The plant is\nunder the dominion of Venus, being of a\ngentle cleansing nature, and withal very\nfriendly to nature. The herb is familiarly\nand frequently used by the Italians to heal\nany fresh or green wound, the leaves being\nbut bruised and bound thereon; and the\njuice thereof is also used in old sores, to\ncleanse, dry, and heal them. The decoction\nhereof made up with some sugar or\nhoney, is available to cleanse and purge\nthe body both upwards and downwards,\nsometimes of tough phlegm and clammy\nhumours, and to open obstructions of the\nliver and spleen. It has been found by\nexperience to be available for the king’s\nevil, the herb bruised and applied, or an\nointment made with the juice thereof, and\nso used; and a decoction of two handfuls\nthereof, with four ounces of Polipody in\nale, has been found by late experience to\ncure divers of the falling sickness, that have\nbeen troubled with it above twenty years.\nI am confident that an ointment of it is\none of the best remedies for scabby head\nthat is."

The herb steeped\nin wine, and the wine drank, refreshes such\nas be over-weary with traveling, and grow\nlame in their joints, either by cold or evil\nlodgings; it helps stitches, and griping\npains in the sides; is an excellent remedy\nfor such as are bruised by falls; it provokes\nurine and the terms exceedingly, therefore\nlet it not be given to women with child:\nThe same is very profitable for such as are\ntroubled with cramps and convulsions, to\ndrink the decoction: Also they say it breaks\nthe stone, and helps ruptures most certainly:\nit is excellent in all cold diseases,\nand such as are troubled with tough phlegm,\nscabs, itch, or any fretting sores and ulcers;\nit is an admirable remedy to kill the worms,\nby taking half a dram of the powder in a\nmorning in any convenient liquor; the same\nis excellently good to be taken inwardly\nfor the king’s evil. It helps agues of all\nsorts, and the yellow jaundice, as also the\nbots in cattle; when kine are bitten on the\nudder by any venomous beast, do but\nstroke the place with the decoction of any\nof these, and it will instantly heal them."

It may safely be applied to inflammations,\ntumours, and swellings in any\npart of the body (save the privy parts) as\nalso to St. Anthony’s fire, wheals, pushes,\nand creeping ulcers that arise of hot sharp\nhumours, by cooling and repelling the heat;\nthe leaves bruised and laid to the brow or\nforehead are good for their eyes that are red\nand swollen; as also to take away a pin\nand web growing in the eye; this is a tried\nmedicine: Take a small handful of this\nherb, and half so much bay salt, beaten\ntogether, and applied to the contrary wrist\nof the hand, for 24 hours, doth remove it\nin thrice dressing. If the root thereof be\nroasted under the embers, wrapped in double\nwet paper, until it be soft and tender,\nand then applied to the gout in the hands\nor fingers, it will quickly help this evil.\nIf any through mistake eat the herb Hemlock\ninstead of Parsley, or the roots instead\nof a Parsnip (both of which it is very\nlike) whereby happens a kind of frenzy, or\nperturbation of the senses, as if they were\nstupid and drunk, the remedy is (as Pliny\nsaith) to drink of the best and strongest\npure wine, before it strikes to the heart, or\nGentian put in wine, or a draught of vinegar,\nwherewith Tragus doth affirm, that he\ncured a woman that had eaten the root."

The juice\nalso takes away worts and corns in the\nhands or feet, being often bathed therewith,\nand the skin and leaves being laid on them\nafterwards. It eases also the head-ache,\nand distempered heat of the brain in\nfrenzies, or through want of sleep, being\napplied to the temples and forehead. The\nleaves bruised and laid upon the crown or\nseam of the head, stays bleeding at the nose\nvery quickly. The distilled water of the\nherb is profitable for all the purposes aforesaid.\nThe leaves being gently rubbed on\nany place stung with nettles or bees, doth\nquickly take away the pain.\nHOUND’S TONGUE.\nDescript.] The great ordinary Hound’s\nTongue has many long and somewhat\nnarrow, soft, hairy, darkish green leaves,\nlying on the ground, somewhat like unto\nBugloss leaves, from among which rises\nup a rough hairy stalk about two feet high,\nwith some smaller leaves thereon, and\nbranched at the tops into divers parts, with\na small leaf at the foot of every branch,\nwhich is somewhat long, with many flowers\nset along the same, which branch is crooked\nor turned inwards before it flowers, and\nopens by degrees as the flowers blow,\nwhich consist of small purplish red leaves\nof a dead colour, rising out of the husks\nwherein they stand with some threads in\nthe middle. It has sometimes a white\nflower. After the flowers are past, there\ncomes rough flat seed, with a small pointle\nin the middle, easily cleaving to any garment\nthat it touches, and not so easily\npulled off again. The root is black, thick,\nand long, hard to break, and full of clammy\njuice, smelling somewhat strong, of an evil\nscent, as the leaves also do.\nPlace.] It grows in moist places of this\nland, in waste grounds, and untilled places,\nby highway sides, lanes, and hedge-sides.\nTime.] It flowers about May or June,\nand the seed is ripe shortly after.\nGovernment and virtues.] It is a plant\nunder the dominion of Mercury. The root\nis very effectually used in pills, as well as\nthe decoction, or otherwise, to stay all sharp\nand thin defluxions of rheum from the head\ninto the eyes or nose, or upon the stomach\nor lungs, as also for coughs and shortness\nof breath. The leaves boiled in wine (saith\nDioscorides, but others do rather appoint it\nto be made with water, and add thereto\noil and salt) molifies or opens the belly\ndownwards. It also helps to cure the biting\nof a mad dog, some of the leaves being also\napplied to the wound: The leaves bruised,\nor the juice of them boiled in hog’s lard,\nand applied, helps falling away of the hair,\nwhich comes of hot and sharp humours;\nas also for any place that is scalded or\nburnt; the leaves bruised and laid to any\ngreen wound doth heal it up quickly: the\nroot baked under the embers, wrapped in\npaste or wet paper, or in a wet double cloth,\nand thereof a suppository made, and put\nup into or applied to the fundament, doth\nvery effectually help the painful piles or\nhæmorrhoids. The distilled water of the\nherbs and roots is very good to all the purposes\naforesaid, to be used as well inwardly\nto drink, as outwardly to wash any sore[99]\nplace, for it heals all manner of wounds and\npunctures, and those foul ulcers that arise\nby the French pox. Mizaldus adds that\nthe leaves laid under the feet, will keep the\ndogs from barking at you. It is called\nHound’s-tongue, because it ties the tongues\nof hounds; whether true, or not, I never\ntried, yet I cured the biting of a mad dog\nwith this only medicine.\nHOLLY, HOLM, OR HULVER BUSH.\nFor to describe a tree so well known is\nneedless.\nGovernment and virtues.] The tree is\nSaturnine. The berries expel wind, and\ntherefore are held to be profitable in the\ncholic. The berries have a strong faculty\nwith them; for if you eat a dozen of them\nin the morning fasting when they are ripe\nand not dried, they purge the body of gross\nand clammy phlegm: but if you dry the\nberries, and beat them into powder, they\nbind the body, and stop fluxes, bloody-fluxes,\nand the terms in women. The bark\nof the tree, and also the leaves, are excellently\ngood, being used in fomentations for\nbroken bones, and such members as are out\nof joint. Pliny saith, the branches of the\ntree defend houses from lightning, and men\nfrom witchcraft.\nST. JOHN’S WORT.\nThis is a very beautiful shrub, and is\na great ornament to our meadows.\nDescript.] Common St. John’s Wort\nshoots forth brownish, upright, hard, round\nstalks, two feet high, spreading many\nbranches from the sides up to the tops of\nthem, with two small leaves set one against\nanother at every place, which are of a deep\ngreen colour, somewhat like the leaves of\nthe lesser Centaury, but narrow, and full of\nsmall holes in every leaf, which cannot be\nso well perceived, as when they are held up\nto the light; at the tops of the stalks and\nbranches stand yellow flowers of five leaves\na-piece, with many yellow threads in the\nmiddle, which being bruised do yield a reddish\njuice like blood; after which come\nsmall round heads, wherein is contained\nsmall blackish seed smelling like rosin.\nThe root is hard and woody, with divers\nstrings and fibres at it, of a brownish colour,\nwhich abides in the ground many years,\nshooting anew every Spring.\nPlace.] This grows in woods and copses,\nas well those that are shady, as open to the\nsun.\nTime.] They flower about Midsummer\nand July, and their seed is ripe in the latter\nend of July or August.\nGovernment and virtues.] It is under the\ncelestial sign Leo, and the dominion of the\nSun. It may be, if you meet a Papist, he\nwill tell you, especially if he be a lawyer,\nthat St. John made it over to him by a\nletter of attorney. It is a singular wound\nherb; boiled in wine and drank, it heals\ninward hurts or bruises; made into an ointment,\nit open obstructions, dissolves swellings,\nand closes up the lips of wounds. The\ndecoction of the herb and flowers, especially\nof the seed, being drank in wine, with\nthe juice of knot-grass, helps all manner of\nvomiting and spitting of blood, is good for\nthose that are bitten or stung by any venomous\ncreature, and for those that cannot\nmake water. Two drams of the seed of\nSt. John’s Wort made into powder, and\ndrank in a little broth, doth gently expel\ncholer or congealed blood in the stomach.\nThe decoction of the leaves and seeds\ndrank somewhat warm before the fits of\nagues, whether they be tertains or quartans,\nalters the fits, and, by often using, doth\ntake them quite away. The seed is much\ncommended, being drank for forty days\ntogether, to help the sciatica, the falling-sickness,\nand the palsy."

The smell or scent thereof is somewhat\nnear unto Bazil; it encreases by the\nroot under ground as all the others do.\nPlace.] It is an usual inhabitant in gardens;\nand because it seldom gives any\ngood seed, the seed is recompensed by\nthe plentiful increase of the root, which\nbeing once planted in a garden, will hardly\nbe rid out again.\nTime.] It flowers not until the beginning\nof August, for the most part.\nGovernment and virtues.] It is an herb\nof Venus. Dioscorides saith it hath a\nhealing, binding and drying quality, and\ntherefore the juice taken in vinegar, stays\nbleeding: It stirs up venery, or bodily lust;\ntwo or three branches thereof taken in the\njuice of four pomegranates, stays the hiccough,\nvomiting, and allays the choler. It\ndissolves imposthumes being laid to with\nbarley-meal. It is good to repress the\nmilk in women’s breasts, and for such as[118]\nhave swollen, flagging, or great breasts.\nApplied with salt, it helps the biting of a\nmad dog; with mead and honeyed water,\nit eases the pains of the ears, and takes\naway the roughness of the tongue, being\nrubbed thereupon. It suffers not milk to\ncurdle in the stomach, if the leaves thereof\nbe steeped or boiled in it before you drink\nit. Briefly it is very profitable to the\nstomach. The often use hereof is a very\npowerful medicine to stay women’s courses\nand the whites. Applied to the forehead\nand temples, it eases the pains in the head,\nand is good to wash the heads of young\nchildren therewith, against all manner of\nbreakings-out, sores or scabs, therein. It\nis also profitable against the poison of venomous\ncreatures. The distilled water of\nMint is available to all the purposes aforesaid,\nyet more weakly. But if a spirit\nthereof be rightly and chymically drawn,\nit is much more powerful than the herb\nitself. Simeon Sethi saith, it helps a cold\nliver, strengthens the belly, causes digestion,\nstays vomits and hiccough; it is good\nagainst the gnawing of the heart, provokes\nappetite, takes away obstructions of the\nliver, and stirs up bodily lust; but therefore\ntoo much must not be taken, because it\nmakes the blood thin and wheyish, and\nturns it into choler, and therefore choleric\npersons must abstain from it. It is a safe\nmedicine for the biting of a mad dog, being\nbruised with salt and laid thereon. The\npowder of it being dried and taken after\nmeat, helps digestion, and those that are\nsplenetic. Taken with wine, it helps women\nin their sore travail in child-bearing. It is\ngood against the gravel and stone in the\nkidneys, and the stranguary. Being\nsmelled unto, it is comfortable for the head\nand memory. The decoction hereof gargled\nin the mouth, cures the gums and\nmouth that are sore, and mends an ill-savoured\nbreath; as also the Rue and Coriander,\ncauses the palate of the mouth to\nturn to its place, the decoction being gargled\nand held in the mouth.\nThe virtues of the Wild or Horse Mint,\nsuch as grow in ditches (whose description\nI purposely omitted, in regard they are\nwell known) are serviceable to dissolve wind\nin the stomach, to help the cholic, and those\nthat are short-winded, and are an especial\nremedy for those that have veneral dreams\nand pollutions in the night, being outwardly\napplied. The juice dropped into the ears\neases the pains of them, and destroys the\nworms that breed therein. They are good\nagainst the venemous biting of serpents.\nThe juice laid on warm, helps the king’s\nevil, or kernels in the throat. The decoction\nor distilled water helps a stinking breath,\nproceeding from corruption of the teeth,\nand snuffed up the nose, purges the head.\nPliny saith, that eating of the leaves hath\nbeen found by experience to cure the\nleprosy, applying some of them to the face,\nand to help the scurf or dandriff of the\nhead used with vinegar. They are extremely\nbad for wounded people; and they say a\nwounded man that eats Mint, his wound\nwill never be cured, and that is a long day."

The Tree\nMoss grows only on trees.\nGovernment and virtues.] All sorts of[121]\nMosses are under the dominion of Saturn.\nThe Ground Moss is held to be singularly\ngood to break the stone, and to expel and\ndrive it forth by urine, being boiled in wine\nand drank. The herb being bruised and\nboiled in water, and applied, eases all inflammations\nand pains coming from an hot\ncause; and is therefore used to ease the\npains of the gout.\nThe Tree Mosses are cooling and binding,\nand partake of a digesting and molifying\nquality withal, as Galen saith. But each\nMoss partakes of the nature of the tree\nfrom whence it is taken; therefore that of\nthe oak is more binding, and is of good effect\nto stay fluxes in man or woman; as also\nvomiting or bleeding, the powder thereof\nbeing taken in wine. The decoction thereof\nin wine is very good for women to be\nbathed in, that are troubled with the overflowing\nof their courses. The same being\ndrank, stays the stomach that is troubled\nwith casting, or hiccough; and, as Avicena\nsaith, it comforts the heart.

The flowers are small\nand yellow, that grow on the tops of the\nbranches in long spikes, flowering by degrees;\nso that continuing long in flower,\nthe stalk will have small round cods at the\nbottom, growing upright and close to the\nstalk, while the top flowers yet shew themselves,\nin which are contained small yellow\nseed, sharp and strong, as the herb is also.\nThe root grows down slender and woody,\nyet abiding and springing again every\nyear.\nPlace.] This grows frequently in this\nland, by the ways and hedge-sides, and\nsometimes in the open fields.\nTime.] It flowers most usually about\nJuly.\nGovernment and virtues.] Mars owns this\nherb also. It is singularly good in all the\ndiseases of the chest and lungs, hoarseness[126]\nof voice: and by the use of the decoction\nthereof for a little space, those have been\nrecovered who had utterly lost their voice,\nand almost their spirits also. The juice\nthereof made into a syrup, or licking medicine,\nwith honey or sugar, is no less effectual\nfor the same purpose, and for all other\ncoughs, wheezing, and shortness of breath.\nThe same is also profitable for those that\nhave the jaundice, pleurisy, pains in the\nback and loins, and for torments in the\nbelly, or cholic, being also used in clysters.\nThe seed is held to be a special remedy\nagainst poison and venom. It is singularly\ngood for the sciatica, and in joint-aches,\nulcers, and cankers in the mouth, throat, or\nbehind the ears, and no less for the hardness\nand swelling of the testicles, or of\nwomen’s breasts.\nNAILWORT, OR WHITLOW-GRASS.\nDescript.] This very small and common\nherb hath no roots, save only a few strings:\nneither doth it ever grow to be above a\nhand’s breadth high, the leaves are very\nsmall, and something long, not much unlike\nthose of Chickweed, among which rise up\ndivers slender stalks, bearing many white\nflowers one above another, which are exceeding\nsmall; after which come small\nflat pouches containing the seed, which is\nvery small, but of a sharp taste.\nPlace.] It grows commonly upon old\nstone and brick walls, and sometimes in\ngravelly grounds, especially if there be\ngrass or moss near to shadow it.\nTime.] They flower very early in the\nyear, sometimes in January, and in\nFebruary; for before the end of April they\nare not to be found.\nGovernment and virtues.] It is held to be\nexceedingly good for those imposthumes in\nthe joints, and under the nails, which they\ncall Whitlows, Felons, Andicorns and Nail-wheals.\nNEP, OR CATMINT.\nDescript.] Common Garden Nep shoots\nforth hard four-square stalks, with a hoariness\non them, a yard high or more, full of\nbranches, bearing at every joint two broad\nleaves like balm, but longer pointed, softer,\nwhite, and more hoary, nicked about the\nedges, and of a strong sweet scent. The\nflowers grow in large tufts at the tops of the\nbranches, and underneath them likewise on\nthe stalks many together, of a whitish purple\ncolour. The roots are composed of\nmany long strings or fibres, fastening themselves\nstronger in the ground, and abide\nwith green leaves thereon all the winter.\nPlace.] It is only nursed up in our\ngardens.\nTime.] And it flowers in July, or thereabouts.\nGovernment and virtues.] It is an herb of\nVenus. Nep is generally used for women\nto procure their courses, being taken inwardly\nor outwardly, either alone, or with\nother convenient herbs in a decoction to\nbathe them, or sit over the hot fumes thereof;\nand by the frequent use thereof, it takes\naway barrenness, and the wind, and pains\nof the mother. It is also used in pains of\nthe head coming of any cold cause, catarrhs,\nrheums, and for swimming and giddiness\nthereof, and is of special use for the windiness\nof the stomach and belly. It is effectual\nfor any cramp, or cold aches, to dissolve\ncold and wind that afflict the place,\nand is used for colds, coughs, and shortness\nof breath. The juice thereof drank\nin wine, is profitable for those that are\nbruised by an accident. The green herb\nbruised and applied to the fundament and\nlying there two or three hours, eases the\npains of the piles; the juice also being made\nup into an ointment, is effectual for the\nsame purpose. The head washed with a\ndecoction thereof, it takes away scabs,[127]\nand may be effectual for other parts of the\nbody also."

The distilled water or juice is\nmuch esteemed by French dames to cleanse\nthe skin from any roughness and deformity,\nor discolouring thereof; being boiled\nin wine and given to drink, it is a good\nremedy against the plague, and other pestilential\nfevers, if the party after taking it\nbe warm in his bed, and sweat for two\nhours after, and use the same for twice at\nleast. It helps also all stingings and\nbitings of venomous beasts, or mad dogs,\nbeing used inwardly, and applied outwardly.\nThe same also opens obstructions of\nthe liver, and is very available against the\ninfirmities of the reins: It provokes urine,\nand helps to expel the stone and gravel\nout of the kidneys and bladder, and helps\nmuch in all inward pains and ulcers. The\ndecoction, or distilled water, is no less effectual\nto be applied to all wounds that are\nfresh and green, or old, filthy, fretting, and\nrunning ulcers, which it very effectually\ncures in a short space. A little mixed\nwith the juice, and dropped into the eyes,\ncleanses them from cloudy mists, or thick\nfilms which grow over them, and hinder\nthe sight. It helps the tooth-ache, being\ndropped into the ear on a contrary side of\nthe pain.

The root is small\nand woody, perishing every year.\nPlace.] It grows more plentifully in\nKent than any other county of this land, as\nnamely, in many places on this side Dartford,\nalong to Southfleet, Chatham, and\nRochester, and upon Chatham down, hard\nby the Beacon, and half a mile from\nRochester, in a field near a house called\nSelesys.\nTime.] It flowers and gives seed in the\nSummer months.\nGovernment and virtues.] Mars owns the\nherb. The decoction of Ground Pine\ndrank, doth wonderfully prevail against the\nstranguary, or any inward pains arising\nfrom the diseases of the reins and urine,\nand is especially good for all obstructions of\nthe liver and spleen, and gently opens\nthe body; for which purpose they were\nwont in former times to make pills with the\npowder thereof, and the pulp of figs. It\nmarvellously helps all the diseases of the\nmother, inwardly or outwardly applied,\nprocuring women’s courses, and expelling\nthe dead child and after-birth; yea, it is so\npowerful upon those feminine parts, that it\nis utterly forbidden for women with child,\nfor it will cause abortion or delivery before\nthe time. The decoction of the herb in\nwine taken inwardly, or applied outwardly,\nor both, for some time together, is also\neffectual in all pains and diseases of the\njoints, as gouts, cramps, palsies, sciatica, and\naches; for which purpose the pills made\nwith powder of Ground Pine, and of Hermodactyls\nwith Venice Turpentine are very\neffectual. The pills also, continued for\nsome time, are special good for those that\nhave the dropsy, jaundice, and for griping\npains of the joints, belly, or inward parts.\nIt helps also all diseases of the brain, proceeding\nof cold and phlegmatic humours\nand distillations, as also for the falling sickness.\nIt is a special remedy for the poison[141]\nof the aconites, and other poisonous herbs,\nas also against the stinging of any venomous\ncreature. It is a good remedy for a\ncold cough, especially in the beginning.\nFor all the purposes aforesaid, the herb\nbeing tunned up in new drink and drank,\nis almost as effectual, but far more acceptable\nto weak and dainty stomachs.

    "cleaned_text": "POPPY.\nOf this I shall describe three kinds, viz.\nthe White and Black of the Garden, and\nthe Erratic Wild Poppy, or Corn Rose.\nDescript.] The White Poppy hath at\nfirst four or five whitish green leaves lying\nupon the ground, which rise with the stalk,\ncompassing it at the bottom of them, and\nare very large, much cut or torn on the\nedges, and dented also besides: The stalk,\nwhich is usually four or five feet high, hath\nsometimes no branches at the top, and\nusually but two or three at most, bearing\nevery one but one head wrapped up in a\nthin skin, which bows down before it is\nready to blow, and then rising, and being\nbroken, the flowers within it spreading itself\nopen, and consisting of four very large,\nwhite, round leaves, with many whitish\nround threads in the middle, set about a\nsmall, round, green head, having a crown,\nor star-like cover at the head thereof, which\ngrowing ripe, becomes as large as a great\napple, wherein are contained a great number\nof small round seeds, in several partitions\nor divisions next unto the shell, the\nmiddle thereof remaining hollow, and\nempty. The whole plant, both leaves,\nstalks, and heads, while they are fresh,\nyoung, and green, yield a milk when they\nare broken, of an unpleasant bitter taste,\nalmost ready to provoke casting, and of a\nstrong heady smell, which being condensed,\nis called Opium. The root is white and\nwoody, perishing as soon as it hath given\nripe seed.\nThe Black Poppy little differs from the\nformer, until it bears its flower, which is\nsomewhat less, and of a black purplish\ncolour, but without any purple spots in the\nbottom of the leaf. The head of the seed\nis much less than the former, and opens\nitself a little round about the top, under\nthe crown, so that the seed, which is very\nblack, will fall out, if one turn the head\nthereof downward.\nThe wild Poppy, or Corn Rose, hath long\nand narrow leaves, very much cut in on the[145]\nedges into many divisions, of a light green\ncolour, sometimes hairy withal. The stalk\nis blackish and hairy also, but not so tall as\nthe garden kind, having some such like\nleaves thereon to grow below, parted into\nthree or four branches sometimes, whereon\ngrow small hairy heads bowing down before\nthe skin break, wherein the flower is\ninclosed, which when it is fully blown open,\nis of a fair yellowish red or crimson colour,\nand in some much paler, without any spot\nin the bottom of the leaves, having many\nblack soft threads in the middle, compassing\na small green head, which when it is\nripe, is not bigger than one’s little finger’s\nend, wherein is contained much black seeds\nsmaller than that of the garden. The root\nperishes every year, and springs again of\nits own sowing. Of this kind there is one\nlesser in all parts thereof, and differs in\nnothing else.\nPlace.] The garden kinds do not naturally\ngrow wild in any place, but all are\nsown in gardens where they grow.\nThe Wild Poppy or Corn Rose, is plentifully\nenough, and many times too much so\nin the corn fields of all counties through this\nland, and also on ditch banks, and by\nhedge sides. The smaller wild kind is also\nfound in corn fields, and also in some\nother places, but not so plentifully as the\nformer.\nTime.] The garden kinds are usually\nsown in the spring, which then flower about\nthe end of May, and somewhat earlier, if\nthey spring of their own sowing.\nThe wild kind flower usually from May\nuntil July, and the seed of them is ripe soon\nafter the flowering.\nGovernment and virtues.] The herb is\nLunar, and of the juice of it is made opium;\nonly for lucre of money they cheat you,\nand tell you it is a kind of tear, or some\nsuch like thing, that drops from Poppies\nwhen they weep, and that is somewhere\nbeyond the seas, I know not where beyond\nthe Moon. The garden Poppy heads with\nseeds made into a syrup, is frequently, and\nto good effect used to procure rest, and\nsleep, in the sick and weak, and to stay\ncatarrhs and defluxions of thin rheums\nfrom the head into the stomach and lungs,\ncausing a continual cough, the fore-runner\nof a consumption; it helps also hoarseness\nof the throat, and when one have lost their\nvoice, which the oil of the seed doth likewise.\nThe black seed boiled in wine, and\ndrank, is said also to dry the flux of the\nbelly, and women’s courses. The empty\nshells, or poppy heads, are usually boiled\nin water, and given to procure rest and\nsleep: so doth the leaves in the same manner;\nas also if the head and temples be\nbathed with the decoction warm, or with\nthe oil of Poppies, the green leaves or the\nheads bruised and applied with a little\nvinegar, or made into a poultice with barley-meal\nor hog’s grease, cools and tempers\nall inflammations, as also the disease called\nSt. Anthony’s fire. It is generally used in\ntreacle and mithridate, and in all other\nmedicines that are made to procure rest\nand sleep, and to ease pains in the head as\nwell as in other parts. It is also used to\ncool inflammations, agues, or frenzies, or\nto stay defluxions which cause a cough, or\nconsumptions, and also other fluxes of the\nbelly or women’s courses; it is also put\ninto hollow teeth, to ease the pain, and hath\nbeen found by experience to ease the pains\nof the gout.\nThe Wild Poppy, or Corn Rose (as Matthiolus\nsaith) is good to prevent the falling-sickness.\nThe syrup made with the flower,\nis with good effect given to those that have\nthe pleurisy; and the dried flowers also,\neither boiled in water, or made into powder\nand drank, either in the distilled water of\nthem, or some other drink, works the like\neffect. The distilled water of the flowers\nis held to be of much good use against\nsurfeits, being drank evening and morning;[146]\nIt is also more cooling than any of the\nother Poppies, and therefore cannot but\nbe as effectual in hot agues, frenzies, and\nother inflammations either inward or outward.\nGalen saith, The seed is dangerous\nto be used inwardly."

    "government_virtues": "What a pother\nhave authors made with Roses! What a\nracket have they kept? I shall add, red\nRoses are under Jupiter, Damask under\nVenus, White under the Moon, and Provence\nunder the King of France. The\nwhite and red Roses are cooling and drying,\nand yet the white is taken to exceed\nthe red in both the properties, but is seldom\nused inwardly in any medicine: The bitterness\nin the Roses when they are fresh,\nespecially the juice, purges choler, and\nwatery humours; but being dried, and that\nheat which caused the bitterness being consumed,\nthey have then a binding and astringent\nquality: Those also that are not\nfull blown, do both cool and bind more\nthan those that are full blown, and the\nwhite Rose more than the Red. The decoction\nof red Roses made with wine and used,\nis very good for the head-ache, and pains\nin the eyes, ears, throat, and gums; as also\nfor the fundament, the lower part of the\nbelly and the matrix, being bathed or put\ninto them. The same decoction with the\nRoses remaining in it, is profitably applied\nto the region of the heart to ease the inflammation\ntherein; as also St. Anthony’s\nfire, and other diseases of the stomach.\nBeing dried and beaten to powder, and\ntaken in steeled wine or water, it helps to\nstay women’s courses. The yellow threads\nin the middle of the Roses (which are\nerroneously called the Rose Seed) being\npowdered and drank in the distilled water\nof Quinces, stays the overflowing of women’s\ncourses, and doth wonderfully stay the defluctions\nof rheum upon the gums and teeth,\npreserving them from corruption, and\nfastening them if they be loose, being\nwashed and gargled therewith, and some\nvinegar of Squills added thereto. The heads\nwith the seed being used in powder, or in a\ndecoction, stays the lask and spitting of\nblood. Red Roses do strengthen the heart,\nthe stomach and the liver, and the retentive\nfaculty: They mitigate the pains that[153]\narise from heat, assuage inflammations,\nprocure rest and sleep, stay both whites\nand reds in women, the gonorrhea, or running\nof the reins, and fluxes of the belly: the\njuice of them doth purge and cleanse the\nbody from choler and phlegm. The husks\nof the Roses, with the beards and nails of\nthe Roses, are binding and cooling, and the\ndistilled water of either of them is good for\nthe heat and redness in the eyes, and to\nstay and dry up the rheums and watering\nof them. Of the Red Roses are usually made\nmany compositions, all serving to sundry\ngood uses, viz. Electuary of Roses, Conserve,\nboth moist and dry, which is more\nusually called Sugar of roses, Syrup of dry\nRoses, and Honey of Roses. The cordial\npowder called Diarrhoden Abbatis, and\nAromatica Rosarum. The distilled Water of\nRoses, Vinegar of Roses, Ointment, and Oil\nof Roses, and the Rose leaves dried, are of\ngreat use and effect. To write at large of every\none of these, would make my book smell\ntoo big, it being sufficient for a volume of\nitself, to speak fully of them. But briefly,\nthe Electuary is purging, whereof two or\nthree drams taken by itself in some convenient\nliquor, is a purge sufficient for a\nweak constitution, but may be increased to\nsix drams, according to the strength of the\npatient. It purges choler without trouble,\nit is good in hot fevers, and pains of the\nhead arising from hot choleric humours,\nand heat in the eyes, the jaundice also, and\njoint-aches proceeding of hot humours.\nThe moist Conserve is of much use, both\nbinding and cordial; for until it be about\ntwo years old, it is more binding than\ncordial, and after that, more cordial than\nbinding. Some of the younger Conserve\ntaken with mithridate mixed together, is\ngood for those that are troubled with distillations\nof rheum from the brain to the\nnose, and defluctions of rheum into the\neyes; as also for fluxes and lasks of the\nbelly; and being mixed with the powder\nof mastich, is very good for the gonorrhea,\nand for the looseness of the humours in the\nbody. The old Conserve mixed with Aromaticum\nRosarum, is a very good cordial\nagainst faintings, swoonings, weakness,\nand tremblings of the heart, strengthens,\nboth it and a weak stomach, helps digestion,\nstays casting, and is a very good preservative\nin the time of infection. The dry\nConserve, which is called the Sugar of Roses,\nis a very good cordial to strengthen the\nheart and spirits; as also to stay defluctions.\nThe syrup of dried red Roses\nstrengthens a stomach given to casting,\ncools an over-heated liver, and the blood in\nagues, comforts the heart, and resists putrefaction\nand infection, and helps to stay\nlasks and fluxes. Honey of Roses is much\nused in gargles and lotions to wash sores,\neither in the mouth, throat, or other parts,\nboth to cleanse and heal them, and to stay\nthe fluxes of humours falling upon them.\nIt is also used in clysters both to cool and\ncleanse. The cordial powders, called\nDiarrhoden Abbatis and Aromaticum Rosarum,\ndo comfort and strengthen the heart\nand stomach, procure an appetite, help\ndigestion, stay vomiting, and are very good\nfor those that have slippery bowels, to\nstrengthen them, and to dry up their moisture.\nRed Rose-water is well known, and\nof familiar use on all occasions, and better\nthan Damask Rose-water, being cooling and\ncordial, refreshing, quickening the weak\nand faint spirits, used either in meats or\nbroths, to wash the temples, to smell at the\nnose, or to smell the sweet vapours thereof\nout of a perfuming pot, or cast into a hot\nfire shovel. It is also of much good use\nagainst the redness and inflammations of the\neyes to bathe them therewith, and the temples\nof the head; as also against pain and\nache, for which purpose also Vinegar of\nRoses is of much good use, and to procure\nrest and sleep, if some thereof, and Rose-water\ntogether, be used to smell unto, or the[154]\nnose and temples moistened therewith, but\nmore usually to moisten a piece of a red\nRose-cake, cut for the purpose, and heated\nbetween a double folded cloth, with a little\nbeaten nutmeg, and poppy-seed strewed on\nthe side that must lie next to the forehead\nand temples, and bound so thereto all night.\nThe ointment of Roses is much used against\nheat and inflammations in the head, to anoint\nthe forehead and temples, and being mixt\nwith Unguentum Populneum, to procure rest:\nit is also used for the heat of the liver, the\nback and reins, and to cool and heal pushes,\nwheals, and other red pimples rising in the\nface or other parts. Oil of Roses is not\nonly used by itself to cool any hot swellings\nor inflammations, and to bind and stay\nfluxes of humours unto sores, but is also\nput into ointments and plaisters that are\ncooling and binding, and restraining the\nflux of humours. The dried leaves of the\nred Roses are used both inwardly and outwardly,\nboth cooling, binding, and cordial,\nfor with them are made both Aromaticum,\nRosarum, Diarrhoden Abbatis, and Saccharum\nRosarum, each of whose properties are\nbefore declared. Rose leaves and mint,\nheated and applied outwardly to the\nstomach, stays castings, and very much\nstrengthen a weak stomach; and applied\nas a fomentation to the region of the liver\nand heart, do much cool and temper them,\nand also serve instead of a Rose-cake (as is\nsaid before) to quiet the over-hot spirits,\nand cause rest and sleep. The syrup of\nDamask Roses is both simple and compound,\nand made with Agaric. The simple solutive\nsyrup is a familiar, safe, gentle and easy\nmedicine, purging choler, taken from one\nounce to three or four, yet this is remarkable\nherein, that the distilled water of this syrup\nshould notably bind the belly. The syrup\nwith Agaric is more strong and effectual, for\none ounce thereof by itself will open the\nbody more than the other, and works as\nmuch on phlegm as choler. The compound\nsyrup is more forcible in working on\nmelancholic humours; and available against\nthe leprosy, itch, tetters, &c. and the French\ndisease: Also honey of Roses solutive is\nmade of the same infusions that the syrup\nis made of, and therefore works the same\neffect, both opening and purging, but is\noftener given to phlegmatic than choleric\npersons, and is more used in clysters than\nin potions, as the syrup made with sugar is.\nThe conserve and preserved leaves of those\nRoses are also operative in gently opening\nthe belly.\nThe simple water of Damask Roses is\nchiefly used for fumes to sweeten things, as\nthe dried leaves thereof to make sweet powders,\nand fill sweet bags; and little use\nthey are put to in physic, although they\nhave some purging quality; the wild Roses\nalso are few or none of them used in physic,\nbut are generally held to come near the\nnature of the manured Roses. The fruit of\nthe wild briar, which are called Hips, being\nthoroughly ripe, and made into a conserve\nwith sugar, besides the pleasantness of the\ntaste, doth gently bind the belly, and stay\ndefluctions from the head upon the stomach,\ndrying up the moisture thereof, and helps\ndigestion. The pulp of the hips dried into\na hard consistence, like to the juice of the\nliquorice, or so dried that it may be made\ninto powder and taken into drink, stays\nspeedily the whites in women. The briar\nball is often used, being made into powder\nand drank, to break the stone, to provoke\nurine when it is stopped, and to ease and\nhelp the cholic; some appoint it to be\nburnt, and then taken for the same purpose.\nIn the middle of the balls are often found\ncertain white worms, which being dried and\nmade into powder, and some of it drank,\nis found by experience of many to kill and\ndrive forth the worms of the belly.\n[155]\nROSA SOLIS, OR SUN DEW.\nIt is likewise called Red-rot, and Youth-wort.\nDescript.] It hath, divers small, round,\nhollow leaves somewhat greenish, but full of\ncertain red hairs, which make them seem\nred, every one standing upon his own foot-stalk,\nreddish, hairy likewise.

    "full_text": "ROSES.\nI hold it altogether needless to trouble\nthe reader with a description of any of these,\nsince both the garden Roses, and the Roses\nof the briars are well enough known: take\ntherefore the virtues of them as follows;\nAnd first I shall begin with the garden\nkinds.\nGovernment and virtues.] What a pother\nhave authors made with Roses! What a\nracket have they kept? I shall add, red\nRoses are under Jupiter, Damask under\nVenus, White under the Moon, and Provence\nunder the King of France. The\nwhite and red Roses are cooling and drying,\nand yet the white is taken to exceed\nthe red in both the properties, but is seldom\nused inwardly in any medicine: The bitterness\nin the Roses when they are fresh,\nespecially the juice, purges choler, and\nwatery humours; but being dried, and that\nheat which caused the bitterness being consumed,\nthey have then a binding and astringent\nquality: Those also that are not\nfull blown, do both cool and bind more\nthan those that are full blown, and the\nwhite Rose more than the Red. The decoction\nof red Roses made with wine and used,\nis very good for the head-ache, and pains\nin the eyes, ears, throat, and gums; as also\nfor the fundament, the lower part of the\nbelly and the matrix, being bathed or put\ninto them. The same decoction with the\nRoses remaining in it, is profitably applied\nto the region of the heart to ease the inflammation\ntherein; as also St. Anthony’s\nfire, and other diseases of the stomach.\nBeing dried and beaten to powder, and\ntaken in steeled wine or water, it helps to\nstay women’s courses. The yellow threads\nin the middle of the Roses (which are\nerroneously called the Rose Seed) being\npowdered and drank in the distilled water\nof Quinces, stays the overflowing of women’s\ncourses, and doth wonderfully stay the defluctions\nof rheum upon the gums and teeth,\npreserving them from corruption, and\nfastening them if they be loose, being\nwashed and gargled therewith, and some\nvinegar of Squills added thereto. The heads\nwith the seed being used in powder, or in a\ndecoction, stays the lask and spitting of\nblood. Red Roses do strengthen the heart,\nthe stomach and the liver, and the retentive\nfaculty: They mitigate the pains that[153]\narise from heat, assuage inflammations,\nprocure rest and sleep, stay both whites\nand reds in women, the gonorrhea, or running\nof the reins, and fluxes of the belly: the\njuice of them doth purge and cleanse the\nbody from choler and phlegm. The husks\nof the Roses, with the beards and nails of\nthe Roses, are binding and cooling, and the\ndistilled water of either of them is good for\nthe heat and redness in the eyes, and to\nstay and dry up the rheums and watering\nof them. Of the Red Roses are usually made\nmany compositions, all serving to sundry\ngood uses, viz. Electuary of Roses, Conserve,\nboth moist and dry, which is more\nusually called Sugar of roses, Syrup of dry\nRoses, and Honey of Roses. The cordial\npowder called Diarrhoden Abbatis, and\nAromatica Rosarum. The distilled Water of\nRoses, Vinegar of Roses, Ointment, and Oil\nof Roses, and the Rose leaves dried, are of\ngreat use and effect. To write at large of every\none of these, would make my book smell\ntoo big, it being sufficient for a volume of\nitself, to speak fully of them. But briefly,\nthe Electuary is purging, whereof two or\nthree drams taken by itself in some convenient\nliquor, is a purge sufficient for a\nweak constitution, but may be increased to\nsix drams, according to the strength of the\npatient. It purges choler without trouble,\nit is good in hot fevers, and pains of the\nhead arising from hot choleric humours,\nand heat in the eyes, the jaundice also, and\njoint-aches proceeding of hot humours.\nThe moist Conserve is of much use, both\nbinding and cordial; for until it be about\ntwo years old, it is more binding than\ncordial, and after that, more cordial than\nbinding. Some of the younger Conserve\ntaken with mithridate mixed together, is\ngood for those that are troubled with distillations\nof rheum from the brain to the\nnose, and defluctions of rheum into the\neyes; as also for fluxes and lasks of the\nbelly; and being mixed with the powder\nof mastich, is very good for the gonorrhea,\nand for the looseness of the humours in the\nbody. The old Conserve mixed with Aromaticum\nRosarum, is a very good cordial\nagainst faintings, swoonings, weakness,\nand tremblings of the heart, strengthens,\nboth it and a weak stomach, helps digestion,\nstays casting, and is a very good preservative\nin the time of infection. The dry\nConserve, which is called the Sugar of Roses,\nis a very good cordial to strengthen the\nheart and spirits; as also to stay defluctions.\nThe syrup of dried red Roses\nstrengthens a stomach given to casting,\ncools an over-heated liver, and the blood in\nagues, comforts the heart, and resists putrefaction\nand infection, and helps to stay\nlasks and fluxes. Honey of Roses is much\nused in gargles and lotions to wash sores,\neither in the mouth, throat, or other parts,\nboth to cleanse and heal them, and to stay\nthe fluxes of humours falling upon them.\nIt is also used in clysters both to cool and\ncleanse. The cordial powders, called\nDiarrhoden Abbatis and Aromaticum Rosarum,\ndo comfort and strengthen the heart\nand stomach, procure an appetite, help\ndigestion, stay vomiting, and are very good\nfor those that have slippery bowels, to\nstrengthen them, and to dry up their moisture.\nRed Rose-water is well known, and\nof familiar use on all occasions, and better\nthan Damask Rose-water, being cooling and\ncordial, refreshing, quickening the weak\nand faint spirits, used either in meats or\nbroths, to wash the temples, to smell at the\nnose, or to smell the sweet vapours thereof\nout of a perfuming pot, or cast into a hot\nfire shovel. It is also of much good use\nagainst the redness and inflammations of the\neyes to bathe them therewith, and the temples\nof the head; as also against pain and\nache, for which purpose also Vinegar of\nRoses is of much good use, and to procure\nrest and sleep, if some thereof, and Rose-water\ntogether, be used to smell unto, or the[154]\nnose and temples moistened therewith, but\nmore usually to moisten a piece of a red\nRose-cake, cut for the purpose, and heated\nbetween a double folded cloth, with a little\nbeaten nutmeg, and poppy-seed strewed on\nthe side that must lie next to the forehead\nand temples, and bound so thereto all night.\nThe ointment of Roses is much used against\nheat and inflammations in the head, to anoint\nthe forehead and temples, and being mixt\nwith Unguentum Populneum, to procure rest:\nit is also used for the heat of the liver, the\nback and reins, and to cool and heal pushes,\nwheals, and other red pimples rising in the\nface or other parts. Oil of Roses is not\nonly used by itself to cool any hot swellings\nor inflammations, and to bind and stay\nfluxes of humours unto sores, but is also\nput into ointments and plaisters that are\ncooling and binding, and restraining the\nflux of humours. The dried leaves of the\nred Roses are used both inwardly and outwardly,\nboth cooling, binding, and cordial,\nfor with them are made both Aromaticum,\nRosarum, Diarrhoden Abbatis, and Saccharum\nRosarum, each of whose properties are\nbefore declared. Rose leaves and mint,\nheated and applied outwardly to the\nstomach, stays castings, and very much\nstrengthen a weak stomach; and applied\nas a fomentation to the region of the liver\nand heart, do much cool and temper them,\nand also serve instead of a Rose-cake (as is\nsaid before) to quiet the over-hot spirits,\nand cause rest and sleep. The syrup of\nDamask Roses is both simple and compound,\nand made with Agaric. The simple solutive\nsyrup is a familiar, safe, gentle and easy\nmedicine, purging choler, taken from one\nounce to three or four, yet this is remarkable\nherein, that the distilled water of this syrup\nshould notably bind the belly. The syrup\nwith Agaric is more strong and effectual, for\none ounce thereof by itself will open the\nbody more than the other, and works as\nmuch on phlegm as choler. The compound\nsyrup is more forcible in working on\nmelancholic humours; and available against\nthe leprosy, itch, tetters, &c. and the French\ndisease: Also honey of Roses solutive is\nmade of the same infusions that the syrup\nis made of, and therefore works the same\neffect, both opening and purging, but is\noftener given to phlegmatic than choleric\npersons, and is more used in clysters than\nin potions, as the syrup made with sugar is.\nThe conserve and preserved leaves of those\nRoses are also operative in gently opening\nthe belly.\nThe simple water of Damask Roses is\nchiefly used for fumes to sweeten things, as\nthe dried leaves thereof to make sweet powders,\nand fill sweet bags; and little use\nthey are put to in physic, although they\nhave some purging quality; the wild Roses\nalso are few or none of them used in physic,\nbut are generally held to come near the\nnature of the manured Roses. The fruit of\nthe wild briar, which are called Hips, being\nthoroughly ripe, and made into a conserve\nwith sugar, besides the pleasantness of the\ntaste, doth gently bind the belly, and stay\ndefluctions from the head upon the stomach,\ndrying up the moisture thereof, and helps\ndigestion. The pulp of the hips dried into\na hard consistence, like to the juice of the\nliquorice, or so dried that it may be made\ninto powder and taken into drink, stays\nspeedily the whites in women. The briar\nball is often used, being made into powder\nand drank, to break the stone, to provoke\nurine when it is stopped, and to ease and\nhelp the cholic; some appoint it to be\nburnt, and then taken for the same purpose.\nIn the middle of the balls are often found\ncertain white worms, which being dried and\nmade into powder, and some of it drank,\nis found by experience of many to kill and\ndrive forth the worms of the belly.\n[155]\nROSA SOLIS, OR SUN DEW.\nIt is likewise called Red-rot, and Youth-wort.\nDescript.] It hath, divers small, round,\nhollow leaves somewhat greenish, but full of\ncertain red hairs, which make them seem\nred, every one standing upon his own foot-stalk,\nreddish, hairy likewise. The leaves\nare continually moist in the hottest day,\nyea, the hotter the sun shines on them, the\nmoister they are, with a sliminess that will\nrope (as we say,) the small hairs always\nholding the moisture. Among these leaves\nrise up slender stalks, reddish also, three or\nfour fingers high, bearing divers small white\nknobs one above another, which are flowers;\nafter which in the heads are contained\nsmall seeds. The root is a few small hairs.\nPlace.] It grows usually in bogs and\nwet places, and sometimes in moist woods.\nTime.] It flowers in June, and the leaves\nare then fittest to be gathered.\nGovernment and virtues.] The Sun rules\nit, and it is under the sign Cancer. Rose\nSolis is accounted good to help those that\nhave a salt rheum distilling on their lungs,\nwhich breeds a consumption, and therefore\nthe distilled water thereof in wine is\nheld fit and profitable for such to drink,\nwhich water will be of a good yellow colour.\nThe same water is held to be good for all\nother diseases of the lungs, as phthisicks,\nwheezings, shortness of breath, or the cough;\nas also to heal the ulcers that happen in the\nlungs; and it comforts the heart and fainting\nspirits.

    "description": "At the first appearing out of\nthe ground, when the winter is past, it hath\na great round brownish head, rising from\nthe middle or sides of the root, which opens\nitself into sundry leaves one after another,\nvery much crumpled or folded together at\nthe first, and brownish: but afterwards it\nspreads itself, and becomes smooth, very\nlarge and almost round, every one standing\non a brownish stalk of the thickness of a\nman’s thumb, when they are grown to their\nfulness, and most of them two feet and\nmore in length, especially when they grow\nin any moist or good ground; and the\nstalk of the leaf, from the bottom thereof to\nthe leaf itself, being also two feet, the breadth\nthereof from edge to edge, in the broadest\nplace, being also two feet, of a sad or dark\ngreen colour, of a fine tart or sourish taste,\nmuch more pleasant than the garden or\nwood sorrel. From among these rise up\nsome, but not every year, strong thick\nstalks, not growing so high as the Patience,\nor garden Dock, with such round leaves as\ngrow below, but small at every joint up to\nthe top, and among the flowers, which are\nwhite, spreading forth into many branches,\nconsisting of five or six small leaves a-piece,\nhardly to be discerned from the white\nthreads in the middle, and seeming to be all\nthreads, after which come brownish three\nsquare seeds, like unto other Docks, but\nlarger, whereby it may be plainly known to\nbe a Dock. The root grows in time to be\nvery great, with divers and sundry great\nspreading branches from it, of a dark\nbrownish or reddish colour on the outside,\nhaving a pale yellow skin under it, which\ncovers the inner substance or root, which[157]\nrind and skin being pared away, the root\nappears of so fresh and lively a colour,\nwith fresh coloured veins running through\nit, that the choicest of that Rhubarb that is\nbrought us from beyond the seas cannot\nexcel it, which root, if it be dried carefully,\nand as it ought (which must be in our\ncountry by the gentle heat of a fire, in regard\nthe sun is not hot enough here to do\nit, and every piece kept from touching one\nanother) will hold its colour almost as well\nas when it is fresh, and has been approved\nof, and commended by those who have\noftentimes used them.",

    "government_virtues": "The Sun claims\nprivilege in it, and it is under the celestial\nRam. It is an herb of as great use with us\nin these days as any whatsoever, not only\nfor physical but civil purposes. The physical\nuse of it (being my present task) is\nvery much used both for inward and outward\ndiseases, for by the warming and comforting\nheat thereof it helps all cold diseases,\nboth of the head, stomach, liver, and belly.\nThe decoction thereof in wine, helps the\ncold distillations of rheum into the eyes,\nand all other cold diseases of the head and\nbrain, as the giddiness or swimmings\ntherein, drowsiness or dullness of the mind\nand senses like a stupidness, the dumb palsy,\nor loss of speech, the lethargy, and fallen-sickness,\nto be both drank, and the temples\nbathed therewith. It helps the pains in the\ngums and teeth, by rheum falling into them,\nnot by putrefaction, causing an evil smell\nfrom them, or a stinking breath. It helps\na weak memory, and quickens the senses.\nIt is very comfortable to the stomach in all\nthe cold griefs thereof, helps both retention\nof meat, and digestion, the decoction or\npowder being taken in wine. It is a remedy\nfor the windiness in the stomach, bowels,\nand spleen, and expels it powerfully. It\nhelps those that are liver-grown, by opening\nthe obstructions thereof. It helps dim\neyes, and procures a clear sight, the flowers\nthereof being taken all the while it is flowering\nevery morning fasting, with bread and\nsalt. Both Dioscorides and Galen say,\nThat if a decoction be made thereof with\nwater, and they that have the yellow jaundice\nexercise their bodies directly after the\ntaking thereof, it will certainly cure them.\nThe flowers and conserve made of them,[156]\nare singularly good to comfort the heart,\nand to expel the contagion of the pestilence;\nto burn the herb in houses and chambers,\ncorrects the air in them. Both the flowers\nand leaves are very profitable for women\nthat are troubled with the whites, if they be\ndaily taken.

What\ndishonour is this, not to Mars, but to God\nhimself. A dram of the dried root of\nMonk’s Rhubarb, with a scruple of Ginger\nmade into powder, and taken fasting in a\ndraught or mess of warm broth, purges\ncholer and phlegm downwards very gently\nand safely without danger. The seed[158]\nthereof contrary doth bind the belly, and\nhelps to stay any sort of lasks or bloody-flux.\nThe distilled water thereof is very\nprofitably used to heal scabs; also foul\nulcerous sores, and to allay the inflammation\nof them; the juice of the leaves or\nroots or the decoction of them in vinegar,\nis used as the most effectual remedy to heal\nscabs and running sores.\nThe Bastard Rhubarb hath all the properties\nof the Monk’s Rhubarb, but more\neffectual for both inward and outward diseases.\nThe decoction thereof without vinegar\ndropped into the ears, takes away the\npains; gargled in the mouth, takes away\nthe tooth ache; and being drank, heals the\njaundice. The seed thereof taken, eases\nthe gnawing and griping pains of the\nstomach, and takes away the loathing thereof\nunto meat. The root thereof helps the\nruggedness of the nails, and being boiled in\nwine helps the swelling of the throat, commonly\ncalled the king’s evil, as also the\nswellings of the kernels of the ears. It\nhelps them that are troubled with the stone,\nprovokes urine, and helps the dimness of\nthe sight. The roots of this Bastard Rhubarb\nare used in opening and purging diet-drinks,\nwith other things, to open the liver,\nand to cleanse and cool the blood.\nThe properties of that which is called the\nEnglish Rhubarb are the same with the\nformer, but much more effectual, and hath\nall the properties of the true Italian Rhubarbs,\nexcept the force in purging, wherein\nit is but of half the strength thereof, and\ntherefore a double quantity must be used:\nit likewise hath not that bitterness and astriction;\nin other things it works almost in\nan equal quantity, which are these: It\npurges the body of choler and phlegm, being\neither taken of itself, made into powder, and\ndrank in a draught of white wine, or steeped\ntherein all night, and taken fasting, or put\namong other purges, as shall be thought\nconvenient, cleansing the stomach, liver, and\nblood, opening obstructions, and helping\nthose griefs that come thereof, as the jaundice,\ndropsy, swelling of the spleen, tertain\nand daily agues, and pricking pains of the\nsides; and also stays spitting of blood.\nThe powder taken with cassia dissolved,\nand washed Venice turpentine, cleanses the\nreins and strengthens them afterwards, and\nis very effectual to stay the gonorrhea. It\nis also given for the pains and swellings in\nthe head, for those that are troubled with\nmelancholy, and helps the sciatica, gout,\nand the cramp. The powder of the Rhubarb\ntaken with a little mummia and madder\nroots in some red wine, dissolves clotted\nblood in the body, happening by any fall\nor bruise, and helps burstings and broken\nparts, as well inward as outward. The oil\nlikewise wherein it hath been boiled, works\nthe like effects being anointed. It is used\nto heal those ulcers that happen in the eyes\nor eyelids, being steeped and strained; as\nalso to assuage the swellings and inflammations;\nand applied with honey, boiled\nin wine, it takes away all blue spots or\nmarks that happen therein. Whey or\nwhite wine are the best liquors to steep it\nin, and thereby it works more effectual in\nopening obstructions, and purging the\nstomach and liver. Many do use a little\nIndian Spikenard as the best corrector\nthereof.\nMEADOW-RUE.\nDescript.] Meadow-rue rises up with\na yellow stringy root, much spreading in\nthe ground, shooting forth new sprouts\nround about, with many herby green stalks,\ntwo feet high, crested all the length of them,\nset with joints here and there, and many\nlarge leaves on them, above as well as below,\nbeing divided into smaller leaves,\nnicked or dented in the fore part of them,\nof a red green colour on the upper-side,\nand pale green underneath; Toward the\ntop of the stalk there shoots forth divers[159]\nshort branches, on every one whereof stand\ntwo, three or four small heads, or buttons,\nwhich breaking the skin that incloses them,\nshoots forth a tuft of pale greenish yellow\nthreads, which falling away, there come in\ntheir places small three-cornered cods,\nwherein is contained small, long and round\nseed.

The root\nboiled in water, and the places of the body\nmost troubled with vermin and lice washed\ntherewith while it is warm, destroys them\nutterly. In Italy it is good against the\nplague, and in Saxony against the jaundice,\nas Camerarius saith.\nGARDEN-RUE.\nGarden-rue is so well known by this\nname, and the name Herb of Grace, that I\nshall not need to write any farther description\nof it, but shall shew you the virtue of it,\nas follows.\nGovernment and virtues.] It is an herb of\nthe Sun, and under Leo. It provokes urine\nand women’s courses, being taken either in\nmeat or drink. The seed thereof taken in\nwine, is an antidote against all dangerous\nmedicines or deadly poisons. The leaves\ntaken either by themselves, or with figs and\nwalnuts, is called Mithridate’s counter-poison\nagainst the plague, and causes all venomous\nthings to become harmless; being\noften taken in meat and drink, it abates\nvenery. A decoction thereof with some\ndried dill leaves and flowers, eases all pains\nand torments, inwardly to be drank, and\noutwardly to be applied warm to the place\ngrieved. The same being drank, helps the\npains both of the chest and sides, as also\ncoughs and hardness of breathing, the inflammations\nof the lungs, and the tormenting\npains of the sciatica and the joints, being\nanointed, or laid to the places; as also the\nshaking fits of agues, to take a draught before\nthe fit comes. Being boiled or infused\nin oil, it is good to help the wind cholic,\nthe hardness and windiness of the mother,\nand frees women from the strangling or\nsuffocation thereof, if the share and the\nparts thereabouts be anointed therewith. It\nkills and drives forth the worms of the\nbelly, if it be drank after it is boiled in wine\nto the half, with a little honey; it helps the\ngout or pains in the joints, hands, feet or\nknees, applied thereunto; and with figs it\nhelps the dropsy, being bathed therewith:\nBeing bruised and put into the nostrils, it\nstays the bleeding thereof. It takes away\nwheals and pimples, if being bruised with a\nfew myrtle leaves, it be made up with wax,\nand applied. It cures the morphew, and\ntakes away all sorts of warts, if boiled in\nwine with some pepper and nitre, and the\nplace rubbed therewith, and with almond\nand honey helps the dry scabs, or any\ntetter or ringworm. The juice thereof\nwarmed in a pomegranate shell or rind, and\ndropped into the ears, helps the pains of\nthem.

    "full_text": "RHUBARB.\nDescript.] This has divers large, round,\nthin yellowish green leaves rising from the\nroot, a little waved about the edges, every\none standing upon a reasonably thick and\nlong brownish footstalk, from among which\nrises up a pretty big stalk, about two feet\nhigh, with some such high leaves growing\nthereon, but smaller; at the top whereof\nstand in a long spike many small brownish\nflowers, which turn into a hard three square\nshining brown seed, like the garden Patience\nbefore described. The root grows greater\nthan that, with many branches or great\nfibres thereat, yellow on the outside, and\nsomewhat pale; yellow within, with some\ndiscoloured veins like to the Rhubarb which\nis first described, but much less than it,\nespecially when it is dry.\nPlace and Time.] These also grow in\ngardens, and flower and seed at or near the\nsame time that our true Rhubarb doth, viz.\nthey flower in June, and the seed is ripe in\nJuly.\nGovernment and virtues.] Mars claims\npredominancy over all these wholesome\nherbs: You cry out upon him for an unfortunate,\nwhen God created him for your\ngood (only he is angry with fools.) What\ndishonour is this, not to Mars, but to God\nhimself. A dram of the dried root of\nMonk’s Rhubarb, with a scruple of Ginger\nmade into powder, and taken fasting in a\ndraught or mess of warm broth, purges\ncholer and phlegm downwards very gently\nand safely without danger. The seed[158]\nthereof contrary doth bind the belly, and\nhelps to stay any sort of lasks or bloody-flux.\nThe distilled water thereof is very\nprofitably used to heal scabs; also foul\nulcerous sores, and to allay the inflammation\nof them; the juice of the leaves or\nroots or the decoction of them in vinegar,\nis used as the most effectual remedy to heal\nscabs and running sores.\nThe Bastard Rhubarb hath all the properties\nof the Monk’s Rhubarb, but more\neffectual for both inward and outward diseases.\nThe decoction thereof without vinegar\ndropped into the ears, takes away the\npains; gargled in the mouth, takes away\nthe tooth ache; and being drank, heals the\njaundice. The seed thereof taken, eases\nthe gnawing and griping pains of the\nstomach, and takes away the loathing thereof\nunto meat. The root thereof helps the\nruggedness of the nails, and being boiled in\nwine helps the swelling of the throat, commonly\ncalled the king’s evil, as also the\nswellings of the kernels of the ears. It\nhelps them that are troubled with the stone,\nprovokes urine, and helps the dimness of\nthe sight. The roots of this Bastard Rhubarb\nare used in opening and purging diet-drinks,\nwith other things, to open the liver,\nand to cleanse and cool the blood.\nThe properties of that which is called the\nEnglish Rhubarb are the same with the\nformer, but much more effectual, and hath\nall the properties of the true Italian Rhubarbs,\nexcept the force in purging, wherein\nit is but of half the strength thereof, and\ntherefore a double quantity must be used:\nit likewise hath not that bitterness and astriction;\nin other things it works almost in\nan equal quantity, which are these: It\npurges the body of choler and phlegm, being\neither taken of itself, made into powder, and\ndrank in a draught of white wine, or steeped\ntherein all night, and taken fasting, or put\namong other purges, as shall be thought\nconvenient, cleansing the stomach, liver, and\nblood, opening obstructions, and helping\nthose griefs that come thereof, as the jaundice,\ndropsy, swelling of the spleen, tertain\nand daily agues, and pricking pains of the\nsides; and also stays spitting of blood.\nThe powder taken with cassia dissolved,\nand washed Venice turpentine, cleanses the\nreins and strengthens them afterwards, and\nis very effectual to stay the gonorrhea. It\nis also given for the pains and swellings in\nthe head, for those that are troubled with\nmelancholy, and helps the sciatica, gout,\nand the cramp. The powder of the Rhubarb\ntaken with a little mummia and madder\nroots in some red wine, dissolves clotted\nblood in the body, happening by any fall\nor bruise, and helps burstings and broken\nparts, as well inward as outward. The oil\nlikewise wherein it hath been boiled, works\nthe like effects being anointed. It is used\nto heal those ulcers that happen in the eyes\nor eyelids, being steeped and strained; as\nalso to assuage the swellings and inflammations;\nand applied with honey, boiled\nin wine, it takes away all blue spots or\nmarks that happen therein. Whey or\nwhite wine are the best liquors to steep it\nin, and thereby it works more effectual in\nopening obstructions, and purging the\nstomach and liver. Many do use a little\nIndian Spikenard as the best corrector\nthereof.\nMEADOW-RUE.\nDescript.] Meadow-rue rises up with\na yellow stringy root, much spreading in\nthe ground, shooting forth new sprouts\nround about, with many herby green stalks,\ntwo feet high, crested all the length of them,\nset with joints here and there, and many\nlarge leaves on them, above as well as below,\nbeing divided into smaller leaves,\nnicked or dented in the fore part of them,\nof a red green colour on the upper-side,\nand pale green underneath; Toward the\ntop of the stalk there shoots forth divers[159]\nshort branches, on every one whereof stand\ntwo, three or four small heads, or buttons,\nwhich breaking the skin that incloses them,\nshoots forth a tuft of pale greenish yellow\nthreads, which falling away, there come in\ntheir places small three-cornered cods,\nwherein is contained small, long and round\nseed.

The root\nboiled in water, and the places of the body\nmost troubled with vermin and lice washed\ntherewith while it is warm, destroys them\nutterly. In Italy it is good against the\nplague, and in Saxony against the jaundice,\nas Camerarius saith.\nGARDEN-RUE.\nGarden-rue is so well known by this\nname, and the name Herb of Grace, that I\nshall not need to write any farther description\nof it, but shall shew you the virtue of it,\nas follows.\nGovernment and virtues.] It is an herb of\nthe Sun, and under Leo. It provokes urine\nand women’s courses, being taken either in\nmeat or drink. The seed thereof taken in\nwine, is an antidote against all dangerous\nmedicines or deadly poisons. The leaves\ntaken either by themselves, or with figs and\nwalnuts, is called Mithridate’s counter-poison\nagainst the plague, and causes all venomous\nthings to become harmless; being\noften taken in meat and drink, it abates\nvenery. A decoction thereof with some\ndried dill leaves and flowers, eases all pains\nand torments, inwardly to be drank, and\noutwardly to be applied warm to the place\ngrieved. The same being drank, helps the\npains both of the chest and sides, as also\ncoughs and hardness of breathing, the inflammations\nof the lungs, and the tormenting\npains of the sciatica and the joints, being\nanointed, or laid to the places; as also the\nshaking fits of agues, to take a draught before\nthe fit comes. Being boiled or infused\nin oil, it is good to help the wind cholic,\nthe hardness and windiness of the mother,\nand frees women from the strangling or\nsuffocation thereof, if the share and the\nparts thereabouts be anointed therewith. It\nkills and drives forth the worms of the\nbelly, if it be drank after it is boiled in wine\nto the half, with a little honey; it helps the\ngout or pains in the joints, hands, feet or\nknees, applied thereunto; and with figs it\nhelps the dropsy, being bathed therewith:\nBeing bruised and put into the nostrils, it\nstays the bleeding thereof. It takes away\nwheals and pimples, if being bruised with a\nfew myrtle leaves, it be made up with wax,\nand applied. It cures the morphew, and\ntakes away all sorts of warts, if boiled in\nwine with some pepper and nitre, and the\nplace rubbed therewith, and with almond\nand honey helps the dry scabs, or any\ntetter or ringworm. The juice thereof\nwarmed in a pomegranate shell or rind, and\ndropped into the ears, helps the pains of\nthem. The juice of it and fennel, with a\nlittle honey, and the gall of a cock put thereunto,\nhelps the dimness of the eye-sight.\nAn ointment made of the juice thereof with\noil of roses, ceruse, and a little vinegar, and\nanointed, cures St. Anthony’s fire, and all\nrunning sores in the head: and the stinking\nulcers of the nose, or other parts.

The\nseed is blackish and round; four usually\nseem in a husk together: the root is long[163]\nand stringy, with divers fibres thereat, and\nabides many years.\nPlace.] It grows in woods, and by\nwood-sides; as also in divers fields and\nbye-lanes in the land.\nTime.] It flowers in June, July, and\nAugust.\nGovernment and virtues.] The herb is\nunder Venus. The decoction of the Wood\nSage provokes urine and women’s courses:\nIt also provokes sweat, digests humours,\nand discusses swellings and nodes in the\nflesh, and is therefore thought to be good\nagainst the French pox. The decoction\nof the green herb, made with wine, is a safe\nand sure remedy for those who by falls,\nbruises, or blows, suspect some vein to be\ninwardly broken, to disperse and void the\ncongealed blood, and to consolidate the\nveins. The drink used inwardly, and the\nherb used outwardly, is good for such as\nare inwardly or outwardly bursten, and is\nfound to be a sure remedy for the palsy.\nThe juice of the herb, or the powder thereof\ndried, is good for moist ulcers and sores\nin the legs, and other parts, to dry them,\nand cause them to heal more speedily. It\nis no less effectual also in green wounds, to\nbe used upon any occasion.\nSOLOMON’S SEAL.\nDescript.] The common Solomon’s\nSeal rises up with a round stalk half a yard\nhigh, bowing or bending down to the\nground, set with single leaves one above\nanother, somewhat large, and like the leaves\nof the lily-convally, or May-lily, with an\neye of bluish upon the green, with some\nribs therein, and more yellowish underneath.\nAt the foot of every leaf, almost\nfrom the bottom up to the top of the stalk,\ncome forth small, long, white and hollow\npendulous flowers, somewhat like the\nflowers of May-lily, but ending in five long\npoints, for the most part two together, at the\nend of a long foot-stalk, and sometimes but\none, and sometimes also two stalks, and\nflowers at the foot of a leaf, which are without\nany scent at all, and stand on the top\nof the stalk. After they are past, come in\ntheir places small round berries great at the\nfirst, and blackish green, tending to blueness\nwhen they are ripe, wherein lie small,\nwhite, hard, and stony seeds. The root is\nof the thickness of one’s finger or thumb,\nwhite and knotted in some places, a flat\nround circle representing a Seal, whereof it\ntook the name, lying along under the upper\ncrust of the earth, and not growing downward,\nbut with many fibres underneath.\nPlace.] It is frequent in divers places of\nthis land; as, namely in a wood two miles\nfrom Canterbury, by Fish-Pool Hill, as also\nin Bushy Close belonging to the parsonage\nof Alderbury, near Clarendon, two miles\nfrom Salisbury: in Cheffon wood, on Chesson\nHill, between Newington and Sittingbourn\nin Kent, and divers other places in\nEssex, and other counties.\nTime.] It flowers about May: The\nroot abides and shoots a-new every year.\nGovernment and virtues.] Saturn owns\nthe plant, for he loves his bones well. The\nroot of Solomon’s Seal is found by experience\nto be available in wounds, hurts, and outward\nsores, to heal and close up the lips of\nthose that are green, and to dry up and\nrestrain the flux of humours to those that\nare old. It is singularly good to stay\nvomitings and bleeding wheresoever, as\nalso all fluxes in man or woman; also, to\nknit any joint, which by weakness uses to\nbe often out of place, or will not stay in\nlong when it is set; also to knit and join\nbroken bones in any part of the body, the\nroots being bruised and applied to the\nplaces; yea, it hath been found by experience,\nand the decoction of the root in\nwine, or the bruised root put into wine or\nother drink, and after a night’s infusion,\nstrained forth hard and drank, hath helped\nboth man and beast, whose bones hath been[164]\nbroken by any occasion, which is the most\nassured refuge of help to people of divers\ncounties of the land that they can have. It\nis no less effectual to help ruptures and\nburstings, the decoction in wine, or the\npowder in broth or drink, being inwardly\ntaken, and outwardly applied to the place.\nThe same is also available for inward or outward\nbruises, falls or blows, both to dispel\nthe congealed blood, and to take away\nboth the pains and the black and blue\nmarks that abide after the hurt. The same\nalso, or the distilled water of the whole\nplant, used to the face, or other parts of the\nskin, cleanses it from morphew, freckles,\nspots, or marks whatsoever, leaving the\nplace fresh, fair, and lovely; for which\npurpose it is much used by the Italian\nDames."

The green herb bruised[169]\nand applied to any carbuncle or plague\nsore, is found by certain experience to dissolve\nand break it in three hours space.\nThe same decoction also drank, helps the\npains and stitches in the side. The decoction\nof the roots taken for forty days together,\nor a dram of the powder of them\ntaken at a time in whey, doth (as Matthiolus\nsaith) wonderfully help those that are\ntroubled with running of spreading scabs,\ntetters, ringworms, yea, although they proceed\nfrom the French pox, which, he saith\nhe hath tried by experience. The juice or\ndecoction drank, helps also scabs and\nbreakings-out of the itch, and the like.\nThe juice also made up into an ointment\nand used, is effectual for the same purpose.\nThe same also heals all inward wounds by\nthe drying, cleansing, and healing quality\ntherein: And a syrup made of the juice\nand sugar, is very effectual to all the purposes\naforesaid, and so is the distilled water\nof the herb and flowers made in due season,\nespecially to be used when the green herb\nis not in force to be taken. The decoction\nof the herb and roots outwardly applied,\ndoth wonderfully help all sorts of hard or\ncold swellings in any part of the body, is\neffectual for shrunk sinews or veins, and\nheals green wounds, old sores, and ulcers.\nThe juice of Scabious, made up with the\npowder of Borax and Samphire, cleanses\nthe skin of the face, or other parts of the\nbody, not only from freckles and pimples,\nbut also from morphew and leprosy; the\nhead washed with the decoction, cleanses it\nfrom dandriff, scurf, sores, itch, and the\nlike, used warm. The herb bruised and\napplied, doth in a short time loosen, and\ndraw forth any splinter, broken bone,\narrow head, or other such like thing lying\nin the flesh."

Dioscorides saith, That the\nseed bruised, heated in warm water, and\ndrank, helps those that are bursten, or\ntroubled with cramps or convulsions of the\nsinews, the sciatica, or difficulty in making\nwater, and bringing down women’s courses.\nThe same taken in wine is an antidote, or\ncounter-poison against all deadly poison,\nand drives away serpents and other venomous\ncreatures; as also the smell of the herb,\nbeing burnt, doth the same. The oil thereof\nanointed on the back-bone before the fits of\nagues come, takes them away: It takes\naway inflammations in the eyes, if it be put\nwith some part of a roasted quince, and\nboiled with a few crumbs of bread, and applied.\nBoiled with barley-meal it takes\naway pimples, pushes or wheals that arise\nin the face, or other parts of the body.\nThe seed as well as the dried herb, is often\ngiven to kill the worms in children: The\nherb bruised and laid to, helps to draw forth\nsplinters and thorns out of the flesh. The\nashes thereof dries up and heals old ulcers,\nthat are without inflammation, although by\nthe sharpness thereof it bites sore, and puts\nthem to sore pains; as also the sores in the\nprivy parts of man or woman. The ashes\nmingled with old sallad oil, helps those that\nhave hair fallen, and are bald, causing the\nhair to grow again either on the head or\nbeard. Daranters saith, That the oil made\nof Southern-wood, and put among the ointments\nthat are used against the French disease,\nis very effectual, and likewise kills\nlice in the head. The distilled water of the\nherb is said to help them much that are\ntroubled with the stone, as also for the diseases\nof the spleen and mother. The Germans\ncommend it for a singular wound\nherb, and therefore call it Stabwort. It is\nheld by all writers, ancient and modern,\nto be more offensive to the stomach than\nworm-wood.\nSPIGNEL, OR SPIKENARD.\nDescript.] The roots of common Spignel\ndo spread much and deep in the ground,\nmany strings or branches growing from one\nhead, which is hairy at the top, of a blackish\nbrown colour on the outside, and white\nwithin, smelling well, and of an aromatical\ntaste from whence rise sundry long stalks\nof most fine cut leaves like hair, smaller\nthan dill, set thick on both sides of the\nstalks, and of a good scent. Among these\nleaves rise up round stiff stalks, with a few\njoints and leaves on them, and at the tops\nan umbel of pure white flowers; at the\nedges whereof sometimes will be seen a\nshew of the reddish blueish colour, especially\nbefore they be full blown, and are\nsucceeded by small, somewhat round seeds,\nbigger than the ordinary fennel, and of a\nbrown colour, divided into two parts, and\ncrusted on the back, as most of the umbelliferous\nseeds are.\nPlace.] It grows wild in Lancashire,\nYorkshire, and other northern counties, and\nis also planted in gardens.\nGovernment and virtues.] It is an herb of\nVenus. Galen saith, The roots of Spignel\nare available to provoke urine, and women’s\ncourses; but if too much thereof be taken,\nit causes head-ache. The roots boiled in\nwine or water, and drank, helps the stranguary\nand stoppings of the urine, the wind,\nswellings and pains in the stomach, pains\nof the mother, and all joint-aches. If the\npowder of the root be mixed with honey,\nand the same taken as a licking medicine,\nit breaks tough phlegm, and dries up the\nrheum that falls on the lungs.

It bears also\nblue flowers like Endive, and the seed is\nhardly distinguished from the seed of the\nsmooth or ordinary Endive.\nThe wild Succory hath divers long leaves\nlying on the ground, very much cut in or\ntorn on the edges, on both sides, even to the\nmiddle rib, ending in a point; sometimes\nit hath a rib down to the middle of the\nleaves, from among which rises up a hard,\nround, woody stalk, spreading into many\nbranches, set with smaller and less divided\nleaves on them up to the tops, where stand\nthe flowers, which are like the garden kind,\nand the seed is also (only take notice that\nthe flowers of the garden kind are gone in\non a sunny day, they being so cold, that\nthey are not able to endure the beams of the\nsun, and therefore more delight in the shade)\nthe root is white, but more hard and woody\nthan the garden kind. The whole plant is\nexceedingly bitter.\nPlace.] This grows in many places of\nour land in waste untilled and barren fields.\nThe other only in gardens.\nGovernment and virtues.] It is an herb of\nJupiter. Garden Succory, as it is more\ndry and less cold than Endive, so it opens\nmore. An handful of the leaves, or roots\nboiled in wine or water, and a draught\nthereof drank fasting, drives forth choleric\nand phlegmatic humours, opens obstructions\nof the liver, gall and spleen; helps the\nyellow jaundice, the heat of the reins, and\nof the urine; the dropsy also; and those\nthat have an evil disposition in their bodies,\nby reason of long sickness, evil diet, &c.\nwhich the Greeks call Cachexia. A decoction\nthereof made with wine, and drank, is[177]\nvery effectual against long lingering agues;\nand a dram of the seed in powder, drank in\nwine, before the fit of the ague, helps to\ndrive it away. The distilled water of the\nherb and flowers (if you can take them in\ntime) hath the like properties, and is especially\ngood for hot stomachs, and in\nagues, either pestilential or of long continuance;\nfor swoonings and passions of\nthe heart, for the heat and head-ache in\nchildren, and for the blood and liver. The\nsaid water, or the juice, or the bruised\nleaves applied outwardly, allay swellings,\ninflammations, St. Anthony’s fire, pushes,\nwheals, and pimples, especially used with\na little vinegar; as also to wash pestiferous\nsores. The said water is very effectual for\nsore eyes that are inflamed with redness,\nfor nurses’ breasts that are pained by the\nabundance of milk.\nThe wild Succory, as it is more bitter,\nso it is more strengthening to the stomach\nand liver.\nSTONE-CROP, PRICK-MADAM, OR SMALL-HOUSELEEK.\nDescript.] It grows with divers trailing\nbranches upon the ground, set with many\nthick, flat, roundish, whitish green leaves,\npointed at the ends. The flowers stand\nmany of them together, somewhat loosely.\nThe roots are small, and run creeping under\nground.\nPlace.] It grows upon the stone walls\nand mud walls, upon the tiles of houses and\npent-houses, and amongst rubbish, and in\nother gravelly places.\nTime.] It flowers in June and July, and\nthe leaves are green all the Winter.\nGovernment and virtues.] It is under the\ndominion of the Moon, cold in quality,\nand something binding, and therefore very\ngood to stay defluctions, especially such as\nfall upon the eyes. It stops bleeding, both\ninward and outward, helps cankers, and all\nfretting sores and ulcers; it abates the heat\nof choler, thereby preventing diseases\narising from choleric humours. It expels\npoison much, resists pestilential fevers, being\nexceeding good also for tertian agues: You\nmay drink the decoction of it, if you please,\nfor all the foregoing infirmities. It is so\nharmless an herb, you can scarce use it\namiss: Being bruised and applied to the\nplace, it helps the king’s evil, and any other\nknots or kernels in the flesh; as also the\npiles."

If you make a vinegar of the\nherb, as vinegar of roses is made (you may\nfind out the way in my translation of the\nLondon Dispensatory) and anoint the head\nwith it, it presently stops the pains thereof.\nIt is excellently good to be given either in[184]\nphrenzy or lethargy, although they are two\ncontrary diseases: It helps spitting and\nvoiding of blood, coughing, and vomiting;\nit comforts and strengthens the head,\nstomach, reins, and womb, expels wind,\nand breaks the stone.\nTORMENTIL, OR SEPTFOIL.\nDescript.] This hath reddish, slender,\nweak branches rising from the root, lying\non the ground, rather leaning than standing\nupright, with many short leaves that stand\ncloser to the stalk than cinquefoil (to which\nthis is very like) with the root-stalk compassing\nthe branches in several places; but\nthose that grow to the ground are set upon\nlong foot stalks, each whereof are like the\nleaves of cinquefoil, but somewhat long and\nlesser dented about the edges, many of\nthem divided into five leaves, but most\nof them into seven, whence it is also called\nSeptfoil; yet some may have six, and some\neight, according to the fertility of the soil.\nAt the tops of the branches stand divers\nsmall yellow flowers, consisting of five\nleaves, like those of cinquefoil, but smaller.\nThe root is smaller than bistort, somewhat\nthick, but blacker without, and not so red\nwithin, yet sometimes a little crooked,\nhaving blackish fibres thereat.\nPlace.] It grows as well in woods and\nshadowy places, as in the open champain\ncountry, about the borders of fields in many\nplaces of this land, and almost in every\nbroom field in Essex.\nTime.] It flowers all the Summer long.\nGovernment and virtues.] This is a gallant\nherb of the Sun. Tormentil is most excellent\nto stay all kind of fluxes of blood or\nhumours in man or woman, whether at\nnose, mouth, or belly. The juice of the\nherb and root, or the decoction thereof,\ntaken with some Venice treacle, and the\nperson laid to sweat, expels any venom or\npoison, or the plague, fever, or other contagious\ndiseases, as pox, measles, &c. for it\nis an ingredient in all antidotes or counter\npoisons. Andreas Urlesius is of opinion\nthat the decoction of this root is no less\neffectual to cure the French pox than Guiacum\nor China; and it is not unlikely,\nbecause it so mightily resists putrefaction.\nThe root taken inwardly is most effectual\nto help any flux of the belly, stomach,\nspleen, or blood; and the juice wonderfully\nopens obstructions of the liver and\nlungs, and thereby helps the yellow jaundice.\nThe powder or decoction drank, or\nto sit thereon as a bath, is an assured remedy\nagainst abortion, if it proceed from the\nover flexibility or weakness of the inward\nretentive faculty; as also a plaster made\ntherewith, and vinegar applied to the reins\nof the back, doth much help not only this,\nbut also those that cannot hold their water,\nthe powder being taken in the juice of\nplantain, and is also commended against\nthe worms in children. It is very powerful\nin ruptures and burstings, as also for bruises\nand falls, to be used as well outwardly as\ninwardly. The root hereof made up with\npellitory of Spain and allum, and put into\na hollow tooth, not only assuages the pain,\nbut stays the flux of humours which causes\nit. Tormentil is no less effectual and\npowerful a remedy against outward wounds,\nsores and hurts, than for inward, and is\ntherefore a special ingredient to be used in\nwound drinks, lotions and injections, for\nfoul corrupt rotten sores and ulcers of the\nmouth, secrets, or other parts of the body.\nThe juice or powder of the root put in\nointments, plaisters, and such things that\nare to be applied to wounds or sores, is very\neffectual, as the juice of the leaves and the\nroot bruised and applied to the throat or\njaws, heals the king’s evil, and eases the\npain of the sciatica; the same used with a\nlittle vinegar, is a special remedy against\nthe running sores of the head or other\nparts; scabs also, and the itch or any such\neruptions in the skin, proceeding of salt and[185]\nsharp humours. The same is also effectual\nfor the piles or hæmorrhoids, if they be\nwashed or bathed therewith, or with the\ndistilled water of the herb and roots. It is\nfound also helpful to dry up any sharp\nrheum that distills from the head into the\neyes, causing redness, pain, waterings, itching,\nor the like, if a little prepared tutia, or\nwhite amber, be used with the distilled\nwater thereof. And here is enough, only\nremember the Sun challengeth this herb.\nTURNSOLE, OR HELIOTROPIUM.\nDescript.] The greater Turnsole rises\nwith one upright stalk, about a foot high, or\nmore, dividing itself almost from the bottom,\ninto divers small branches, of a hoary colour;\nat each joint of the stalk and branches grow\nsmall broad leaves, somewhat white and\nhairy. At the tops of the stalks and branches\nstand small white flowers, consisting of four,\nand sometimes five small leaves, set in\norder one above another, upon a small\ncrooked spike, which turns inwards like a\nbowed finger, opening by degrees as the\nflowers blow open; after which in their\nplace come forth cornered seed, four for the\nmost part standing together; the root is\nsmall and thready, perishing every year,\nand the seed shedding every year, raises it\nagain the next spring.\nPlace.] It grows in gardens, and flowers\nand seeds with us, notwithstanding it is not\nnatural to this land, but to Italy, Spain, and\nFrance, where it grows plentifully.\nGovernment and virtues.] It is an herb of\nthe Sun, and a good one too. Dioscorides\nsaith, That a good handful of this, which is\ncalled the Great Turnsole, boiled in water,\nand drank, purges both choler and phlegm;\nand boiled with cummin, helps the stone in\nthe reins, kidneys, or bladder, provokes\nurine and women’s courses, and causes an\neasy and speedy delivery in child-birth.\nThe leaves bruised and applied to places\npained with the gout, or that have been out\nof joint and newly set, and full of pain, do\ngive much ease; the seed and juice of the\nleaves also being rubbed with a little salt\nupon warts and wens, and other kernels in\nthe face, eye-lids, or any other part of the\nbody, will, by often using, take them away.\nMEADOW TREFOIL, OR HONEYSUCKLES.\nIt is so well known, especially by the\nname of Honeysuckles, white and red, that\nI need not describe them.\nPlace.] They grow almost every where\nin this land.\nGovernment and virtues.] Mercury hath\ndominion over the common sort. Dodoneus\nsaith, The leaves and flowers are good\nto ease the griping pains of the gout, the\nherb being boiled and used in a clyster.\nIf the herb be made into a poultice, and\napplied to inflammations, it will ease them.\nThe juice dropped in the eyes, is a familiar\nmedicine, with many country people, to\ntake away the pin and web (as they call it)\nin the eyes; it also allays the heat and\nblood shooting of them. Country people\ndo also in many places drink the juice\nthereof against the biting of an adder; and\nhaving boiled the herb in water, they first\nwash the place with the decoction, and then\nlay some of the herb also to the hurt place.\nThe herb also boiled in swine’s grease, and\nso made into an ointment, is good to apply\nto the biting of any venomous creature.\nThe herb also bruised and heated between\ntiles, and applied hot to the share, causes\nthem to make water who had it stopt before.\nIt is held likewise to be good for\nwounds, and to take away seed. The decoction\nof the herb and flowers, with the\nseed and root, taken for some time, helps\nwomen that are troubled with the whites.\nThe seed and flowers boiled in water, and\nafterwards made into a poultice with some\noil, and applied, helps hard swellings and\nimposthumes.\n[186]"

    "description": "It starts up out of the earth,\nwith many round, woody, hairy stalks from\none root. Its height is four feet, or three at\nleast. The leaves in longitude are long, in\nlatitude narrow, in colour white, in form\nhoary, in similitude like Southernwood, only\nbroader and longer; in taste rather salt than\nbitter, because it grows so near the salt-water;\nat the joints, with the leaves toward\nthe tops it bears little yellow flowers; the\nroot lies deep, and is woody.\nCommon Wormwood I shall not describe,\nfor every boy that can eat an egg knows it.\nRoman Wormwood; and why Roman,\nseeing it grows familiarly in England? It\nmay be so called, because it is good for a\nstinking breath, which the Romans cannot\nbe very free from, maintaining so many\nbad houses by authority of his Holiness.\nDescript.] The stalks are slender, and\nshorter than the common Wormwood by\none foot at least; the leaves are more finely\ncut and divided than they are, but something\nsmaller; both leaves and stalks are\nhoary, the flowers of a pale yellow colour;\nit is altogether like the common Wormwood,\nsave only in bigness, for it is smaller;\nin taste, for it is not so bitter; in smell, for\nit is spicy.",
    "place": "It is frequent in all pastures.",
    "time": "It flowers late, even in the latter",
    "government_virtues": "Will you give\nme leave to be critical a little? I must\ntake leave. Wormwood is an herb of Mars,\nand if Pontanus say otherwise, he is beside\nthe bridge; I prove it thus: What delights\nin martial places, is a martial herb; but\nWormwood delights in martial places (for\nabout forges and iron works you may gather\na cart-load of it,) ergo, it is a martial herb.\nIt is hot and dry in the first degree, viz.\njust as hot as your blood, and no hotter. It\nremedies the evils choler can inflict on the[196]\nbody of man by sympathy. It helps the\nevils Venus and the wanton Boy produce,\nby antipathy; and it doth something else\nbesides. It cleanses the body of choler\n(who dares say Mars doth no good?) It\nprovokes urine, helps surfeits, or swellings\nin the belly; it causes appetite to meat,\nbecause Mars rules the attractive faculty in\nman: The sun never shone upon a better\nherb for the yellow jaundice than this; Why\nshould men cry out so much upon Mars for\nan infortunate, (or Saturn either?) Did\nGod make creatures to do the creation a\nmischief? This herb testifies, that Mars is\nwilling to cure all diseases he causes; the\ntruth is, Mars loves no cowards, nor Saturn\nfools, nor I neither. Take of the flowers of\nWormwood, Rosemary, and Black Thorn,\nof each a like quantity, half that quantity\nof saffron; boil this in Rhenish wine, but\nput it not in saffron till it is almost boiled;\nThis is the way to keep a man’s body in\nhealth, appointed by Camerarius, in his\nbook intitled Hortus Medicus, and it is a\ngood one too. Besides all this, Wormwood\nprovokes the terms. I would willingly\nteach astrologers, and make them physicians\n(if I knew how) for they are most\nfitting for the calling; if you will not believe\nme, ask Dr. Hippocrates, and Dr. Galen,\na couple of gentlemen that our college of\nphysicians keep to vapour with, not to\nfollow. In this our herb, I shall give the pattern\nof a ruler, the sons of art rough cast,\nyet as near the truth as the men of Benjamin\ncould throw a stone: Whereby, my\nbrethren, the astrologers may know by a\npenny how a shilling is coined: As for the\ncollege of physicians, they are too stately to\ncollege or too proud to continue. They\nsay a mouse is under the dominion of the\nMoon, and that is the reason they feed in the\nnight; the house of the Moon is Cancer;\nrats are of the same nature with mice, but\nthey are a little bigger; Mars receives his\nfall in Cancer, ergo, Wormwood being an\nherb of Mars, is a present remedy for the\nbiting of rats and mice. Mushrooms (I\ncannot give them the title of Herba, Frutex,\nor Arbor) are under the dominion of\nSaturn, (and take one time with another,\nthey do as much harm as good;) if any have\npoisoned himself by eating them, Wormwood,\nan herb of Mars, cures him, because\nMars is exalted in Capricorn, the house of\nSaturn, and this it doth by sympathy, as it\ndid the other by antipathy. Wheals, pushes,\nblack and blue spots, coming either by\nbruises or beatings. Wormwood, an herb\nof Mars, helps, because Mars, (as bad you\nlove him, and as you hate him) will not\nbreak your head, but he will give you a\nplaister. If he do but teach you to know\nyourselves, his courtesy is greater than his\ndiscourtesy. The greatest antipathy between\nthe planets, is between Mars and\nVenus: one is hot, the other cold; one\ndiurnal, the other nocturnal; one dry, the\nother moist; their houses are opposite, one\nmasculine, the other feminine; one public,\nthe other private; one is valiant, the other\neffeminate; one loves the light, the other\nhates it; one loves the field, the other sheets;\nthen the throat is under Venus, the quinsy\nlies in the throat, and is an inflammation\nthere; Venus rules the throat, (it being\nunder Taurus her sign.) Mars eradicates\nall diseases in the throat by his herbs (for\nwormwood is one) and sends them to Egypt\non an errand never to return more, this\ndone by antipathy. The eyes are under\nthe Luminaries; the right eye of a man,\nand the left eye of a woman the Sun claims\ndominion over: the left eye of a man, and\nthe right eye of a woman, are privileges of\nthe Moon, Wormwood, an herb of Mars\ncures both; what belongs to the Sun by\nsympathy, because he is exalted in his\nhouse; but what belongs to the Moon by\nantipathy, because he hath his fall in hers.\nSuppose a man be bitten or stung by a\nmartial creature, imagine a wasp, a hornet,[197]\na scorpion, Wormwood, an herb of Mars,\ngives you a present cure; that Mars, choleric\nas he is, hath learned that patience, to\npass by your evil speeches of him, and tells\nyou by my pen, That he gives you no affliction,\nbut he gives you a cure; you need\nnot run to Apollo, nor Æsculapius; and if\nhe was so choleric as you make him to be,\nhe would have drawn his sword for anger,\nto see the ill conditions of these people\nthat can spy his vices, and not his virtues.\nThe eternal God, when he made Mars,\nmade him for public good, and the sons of\nmen shall know it in the latter end of the\nworld. Et cælum Mars solus babet. You\nsay Mars is a destroyer; mix a little Wormwood,\nan herb of Mars, with your ink,\nneither rats nor mice touch the paper written\nwith it, and then Mars is a preserver.\nAstrologers think Mars causes scabs and\nitch, and the virgins are angry with him,\nbecause wanton Venus told them he deforms\ntheir skins; but, quoth Mars, my\nonly desire is, they should know themselves;\nmy herb Wormwood will restore them to\nthe beauty they formerly had, and in that\nI will not come an inch behind my opposite,\nVenus: for which doth the greatest evil, he\nthat takes away an innate beauty, and when\nhe has done, knows how to restore it again?\nor she that teaches a company of wanton\nlasses to paint their faces? If Mars be in\na Virgin, in the nativity, they say he causes\nthe cholic (it is well God hath set some\nbody to pull down the pride of man.) He\nin the Virgin troubles none with the cholic,\nbut them that know not themselves (for who\nknows himself, may easily know all the\nworld.) Wormwood, an herb of Mars, is a\npresent cure for it; and whether it be most\nlike a Christian to love him for his good, or\nhate him for his evil, judge ye. I had almost\nforgotten, that charity thinks no evil.\nI was once in the Tower and viewed the wardrobe,\nand there was a great many fine clothes:\n(I can give them no other title, for I was never\neither linen or woolen draper) yet as brave as\nthey looked, my opinion was that the moths\nmight consume them; moths are under the\ndominion of Mars; this herb Wormwood being\nlaid among cloaths, will make a moth\nscorn to meddle with the cloaths, as much\nas a lion scorns to meddle with a mouse, or\nan eagle with a fly. You say Mars is angry,\nand it is true enough he is angry with\nmany countrymen, for being such fools to\nbe led by the noses by the college of physicians,\nas they lead bears to Paris garden.\nMelancholy men cannot endure to be\nwronged in point of good fame, and that\ndoth sorely trouble old Saturn, because they\ncall him the greatest infortunate; in the\nbody of man he rules the spleen, (and that\nmakes covetous man so splenetic) the poor\nold man lies crying out of his left side.\nFather Saturn’s angry, Mars comes to him;\nCome, brother, I confess thou art evil spoken\nof, and so am I; thou knowest I have my\nexaltation in thy house, I give him an herb\nof mine, Wormwood, to cure the old man:\nSaturn consented, but spoke little, and so\nMars cured him by sympathy. When\nMars was free from war, (for he loves to be\nfighting, and is the best friend a soldier\nhath) I say, when Mars was free from war,\nhe called a council of war in his own brain,\nto know how he should do poor sinful man\ngood, desiring to forget his abuses in being\ncalled an infortunate. He musters up his\nown forces, and places them in battalia.\nOh! quoth he, why do I hurt a poor\nsilly man or woman? His angel answers\nhim, It is because they have offended their\nGod, (Look back to Adam:) Well, says\nMars, though they speak evil of me, I will\ndo good to them; Death’s cold, my herb\nshall heat them: they are full of ill humours\n(else they would never have spoken ill of\nme;) my herb shall cleanse them, and dry\nthem; they are poor weak creatures, my\nherb shall strengthen them; they are dull\nwitted, my herb shall fortify their apprehensions;[198]\nand yet among astrologers all\nthis does not deserve a good word: Oh the\npatience of Mars!\nFelix qui potuit rerum cognoscere caucas,\nInque domus superum scandere cura facit.\nO happy he that can the knowledge gain,\nTo know the eternal God made nought in vain.\nTo this I add,\nI know the reason causeth such a dearth\nOf knowledge; ’tis because men love the earth.\nThe other day Mars told me he met with\nVenus, and he asked her, What was the\nreason that she accused him for abusing\nwomen? He never gave them the pox. In\nthe dispute they fell out, and in anger\nparted, and Mars told me that his brother\nSaturn told him, that an antivenerean\nmedicine was the best against the pox.\nOnce a month he meets with the Moon.\nMars is quick enough of speech, and the\nMoon not much behind hand, (neither are\nmost women.) The Moon looks much\nafter children, and children are much troubled\nwith the worms; she desired a medicine\nof him, he bid her take his own herb,\nWormwood. He had no sooner parted\nwith the Moon, but he met with Venus, and\nshe was as drunk as a hog; Alas! poor\nVenus, quoth he; What! thou a fortune,\nand be drunk? I’ll give thee antipathetical\ncure; Take my herb Wormwood, and thou\nshall never get a surfeit by drinking. A\npoor silly countryman hath got an ague,\nand cannot go about his business: he\nwishes he had it not, and so do I; but I\nwill tell him a remedy, whereby he shall\nprevent it; Take the herb of Mars, Wormwood,\nand if infortunes will do good, what\nwill fortunes do? Some think the lungs are\nunder Jupiter; and if the lungs then the\nbreath; and though sometimes a man gets\na stinking breath, and yet Jupiter is a fortune,\nforsooth; up comes Mars to him;\nCome brother Jupiter, thou knowest I sent\nthee a couple of trines to thy house last\nnight, the one from Aries, and the other\nfrom Scorpio; give me thy leave by sympathy\nto cure this poor man with drinking\na draught of Wormwood beer every morning.\nThe Moon was weak the other day,\nand she gave a man two terrible mischiefs,\na dull brain and a weak sight; Mars laid\nby his sword, and comes to her; Sister\nMoon, said he, this man hath angered thee,\nbut I beseech thee take notice he is but a\nfool; prithee be patient, I will with my herb\nwormwood cure him of both infirmities by\nantipathy, for thou knowest thou and I cannot\nagree; with that the Moon began to\nquarrel; Mars (not delighting much in\nwomen’s tongues) went away, and did it\nwhether she would or no.\nHe that reads this, and understands what\nhe reads, hath a jewel of more worth than\na diamond; he that understands it not, is\nas little fit to give physick. There lies a\nkey in these words which will unlock, (if it\nbe turned by a wise hand) the cabinet of\nphysick: I have delivered it as plain as I\ndurst; it is not only upon Wormwood as\nI wrote, but upon all plants, trees, and\nherbs; he that understands it not, is unfit\n(in my opinion) to give physic. This shall\nlive when I am dead. And thus I leave it\nto the world, not caring a farthing whether\nthey like it or dislike it. The grave equals\nall men, and therefore shall equal me with\nall princes; until which time the eternal\nProvidence is over me: Then the ill tongue\nof a prating fellow, or one that hath more\ntongue than wit, or more proud than\nhonest, shall never trouble me. Wisdom is\njustified by her children. And so much for\nWormwood.\nYARROW, CALLED NOSE-BLEED, MILFOIL\nAND THOUSAND-LEAL.\nDescript.] It hath many long leaves\nspread upon the ground, finely cut, and\ndivided into many small parts. Its flowers\nare white, but not all of a whiteness and[199]\nstayed in knots, upon divers green stalks\nwhich rise from among the leaves.\nPlace.] It is frequent in all pastures.\nTime.] It flowers late, even in the latter\nend of August.\nGovernment and virtues.] It is under the\ninfluence of Venus. An ointment of them\ncures wounds, and is most fit for such as\nhave inflammations, it being an herb of\nDame Venus; it stops the terms in women,\nbeing boiled in white wine, and the decoction\ndrank; as also the bloody flux; the\nointment of it is not only good for green\nwounds, but also for ulcers and fistulas,\nespecially such as abound with moisture.\nIt stays the shedding of hair, the head being\nbathed with the decoction of it; inwardly\ntaken it helps the retentive faculty of the\nstomach: it helps the gonorrhea in men,\nand the whites in women, and helps such as\ncannot hold their water; and the leaves\nchewed in the mouth eases the tooth-ache,\nand these virtues being put together, shew\nthe herb to be drying and binding. Achilles\nis supposed to be the first that left the virtues\nof this herb to posterity, having learned\nthem of this master Chiron, the Centaur;\nand certainly a very profitable herb it is in\ncramps, and therefore called Militaris.\nDIRECTIONS FOR MAKING SYRUPS, CONSERVES,\n&c. &c.\nHaving in divers places of this Treatise\npromised you the way of making Syrups,\nConserves, Oils, Ointments, &c., of herbs,\nroots, flowers, &c. whereby you may have\nthem ready for your use at such times when\nthey cannot be had otherwise; I come now\nto perform what I promised, and you shall\nfind me rather better than worse than my\nword.\nThat this may be done methodically,\nI shall divide my directions into two grand\nsections, and each section into several chapters,\nand then you shall see it look with such\na countenance as this is.",
    "full_text": "WORMWOOD.\nThree Wormwoods are familiar with\nus; one I shall not describe, another I shall\ndescribe, and the third be critical at; and\nI care not greatly if I begin with the last\nfirst.\nSea Wormwood hath gotten as many names\nas virtues, (and perhaps one more) Seriphian,\nSantomeon, Belchion, Narbinense, Hantonicon,\nMisneule, and a matter of twenty\nmore which I shall not blot paper withal.\nA papist got the toy by the end, and he\ncalled it Holy Wormwood; and in truth\nI am opinion, their giving so much holiness\nto herbs, is the reason there remains so\nlittle in themselves. The seed of this\nWormwood is that which women usually\ngive their children for the worms. Of all\nWormwoods that grow here, this is the\nweakest, but Doctors commend it, and\napothecaries sell it; the one must keep his\ncredit, and the other get money, and that is\nthe key of the work. The herb is good for\nsomething, because God made nothing in\nvain: Will you give me leave to weigh\nthings in the balance of reason; Then thus:\nThe seeds of the common Wormwood are\nfar more prevalent than the seed of this, to\nexpel worms in children, or people of ripe\nage; of both some are weak, some are\nstrong. The Seriphian Wormwood is the\nweakest, and haply may prove to be fittest\nfor the weak bodies, (for it is weak enough\nof all conscience.) Let such as are strong\ntake the common Wormwood, for the others\nwill do but little good. Again, near the sea\nmany people live, and Seriphian grows\nnear them, and therefore is more fitting for\ntheir bodies, because nourished by the\nsame air; and this I had from Dr. Reason.\nIn whose body Dr. Reason dwells not, dwells\nDr. Madness, and he brings in his brethren,\nDr. Ignorance, Dr. Folly, and Dr. Sickness,\nand these together make way for\nDeath, and the latter end of that man is\nworse than the beginning. Pride was the\ncause of Adam’s fall; pride begat a daughter,\nI do not know the father of it, unless\nthe devil, but she christened it, and called[195]\nit Appetite, and sent her daughter to taste\nthese wormwoods, who finding this the\nleast bitter, made the squeamish wench\nextol it to the skies, though the virtues of it\nnever reached the middle region of the air.\nIts due praise is this; It is weakest, therefore\nfittest for weak bodies, and fitter for\nthose bodies that dwell near it, than those\nthat dwell far from it; my reason is, the sea\n(those that live far from it, know when they\ncome near it) casts not such a smell as the\nland doth. The tender mercies of God\nbeing over all his works, hath by his eternal\nProvidence, planted Seriphian by the seaside,\nas a fit medicine for the bodies of those\nthat live near it. Lastly, It is known to all\nthat know any thing in the course of nature,\nthat the liver delights in sweet things, if so,\nit abhors bitter; then if your liver be weak,\nit is none of the wisest courses to plague it\nwith an enemy. If the liver be weak, a\nconsumption follows; would you know the\nreason? It is this, A man’s flesh is repaired\nby blood, by a third concoction, which\ntransmutes the blood into flesh, it is well\nI said, (concoction) say I, if I had said\n(boiling) every cook would have understood\nme. The liver makes blood, and if it be\nweakened that if it makes not enough, the\nflesh wastes; and why must flesh always be\nrenewed? Because the eternal God, when\nhe made the creation, made one part of it\nin continual dependency upon another;\nand why did he so? Because himself only\nis permanent; to teach us, That we should\nnot fix our affections upon what is transitory,\nbut what endures for ever. The result\nof this is, if the liver be weak, and cannot\nmake blood enough, I would have said,\nSanguify, if I had written only to scholars,\nthe Seriphian, which is the weakest of\nWormwoods, is better than the best. I have\nbeen critical enough, if not too much.\nPlace.] It grows familiarly in England,\nby the sea-side.\nDescript.] It starts up out of the earth,\nwith many round, woody, hairy stalks from\none root. Its height is four feet, or three at\nleast. The leaves in longitude are long, in\nlatitude narrow, in colour white, in form\nhoary, in similitude like Southernwood, only\nbroader and longer; in taste rather salt than\nbitter, because it grows so near the salt-water;\nat the joints, with the leaves toward\nthe tops it bears little yellow flowers; the\nroot lies deep, and is woody.\nCommon Wormwood I shall not describe,\nfor every boy that can eat an egg knows it.\nRoman Wormwood; and why Roman,\nseeing it grows familiarly in England?

I must\ntake leave. Wormwood is an herb of Mars,\nand if Pontanus say otherwise, he is beside\nthe bridge; I prove it thus: What delights\nin martial places, is a martial herb; but\nWormwood delights in martial places (for\nabout forges and iron works you may gather\na cart-load of it,) ergo, it is a martial herb.\nIt is hot and dry in the first degree, viz.\njust as hot as your blood, and no hotter. It\nremedies the evils choler can inflict on the[196]\nbody of man by sympathy. It helps the\nevils Venus and the wanton Boy produce,\nby antipathy; and it doth something else\nbesides. It cleanses the body of choler\n(who dares say Mars doth no good?) It\nprovokes urine, helps surfeits, or swellings\nin the belly; it causes appetite to meat,\nbecause Mars rules the attractive faculty in\nman: The sun never shone upon a better\nherb for the yellow jaundice than this; Why\nshould men cry out so much upon Mars for\nan infortunate, (or Saturn either?) Did\nGod make creatures to do the creation a\nmischief? This herb testifies, that Mars is\nwilling to cure all diseases he causes; the\ntruth is, Mars loves no cowards, nor Saturn\nfools, nor I neither. Take of the flowers of\nWormwood, Rosemary, and Black Thorn,\nof each a like quantity, half that quantity\nof saffron; boil this in Rhenish wine, but\nput it not in saffron till it is almost boiled;\nThis is the way to keep a man’s body in\nhealth, appointed by Camerarius, in his\nbook intitled Hortus Medicus, and it is a\ngood one too. Besides all this, Wormwood\nprovokes the terms. I would willingly\nteach astrologers, and make them physicians\n(if I knew how) for they are most\nfitting for the calling; if you will not believe\nme, ask Dr. Hippocrates, and Dr. Galen,\na couple of gentlemen that our college of\nphysicians keep to vapour with, not to\nfollow. In this our herb, I shall give the pattern\nof a ruler, the sons of art rough cast,\nyet as near the truth as the men of Benjamin\ncould throw a stone: Whereby, my\nbrethren, the astrologers may know by a\npenny how a shilling is coined: As for the\ncollege of physicians, they are too stately to\ncollege or too proud to continue. They\nsay a mouse is under the dominion of the\nMoon, and that is the reason they feed in the\nnight; the house of the Moon is Cancer;\nrats are of the same nature with mice, but\nthey are a little bigger; Mars receives his\nfall in Cancer, ergo, Wormwood being an\nherb of Mars, is a present remedy for the\nbiting of rats and mice. Mushrooms (I\ncannot give them the title of Herba, Frutex,\nor Arbor) are under the dominion of\nSaturn, (and take one time with another,\nthey do as much harm as good;) if any have\npoisoned himself by eating them, Wormwood,\nan herb of Mars, cures him, because\nMars is exalted in Capricorn, the house of\nSaturn, and this it doth by sympathy, as it\ndid the other by antipathy. Wheals, pushes,\nblack and blue spots, coming either by\nbruises or beatings. Wormwood, an herb\nof Mars, helps, because Mars, (as bad you\nlove him, and as you hate him) will not\nbreak your head, but he will give you a\nplaister. If he do but teach you to know\nyourselves, his courtesy is greater than his\ndiscourtesy. The greatest antipathy between\nthe planets, is between Mars and\nVenus: one is hot, the other cold; one\ndiurnal, the other nocturnal; one dry, the\nother moist; their houses are opposite, one\nmasculine, the other feminine; one public,\nthe other private; one is valiant, the other\neffeminate; one loves the light, the other\nhates it; one loves the field, the other sheets;\nthen the throat is under Venus, the quinsy\nlies in the throat, and is an inflammation\nthere; Venus rules the throat, (it being\nunder Taurus her sign.) Mars eradicates\nall diseases in the throat by his herbs (for\nwormwood is one) and sends them to Egypt\non an errand never to return more, this\ndone by antipathy. The eyes are under\nthe Luminaries; the right eye of a man,\nand the left eye of a woman the Sun claims\ndominion over: the left eye of a man, and\nthe right eye of a woman, are privileges of\nthe Moon, Wormwood, an herb of Mars\ncures both; what belongs to the Sun by\nsympathy, because he is exalted in his\nhouse; but what belongs to the Moon by\nantipathy, because he hath his fall in hers.\nSuppose a man be bitten or stung by a\nmartial creature, imagine a wasp, a hornet,[197]\na scorpion, Wormwood, an herb of Mars,\ngives you a present cure; that Mars, choleric\nas he is, hath learned that patience, to\npass by your evil speeches of him, and tells\nyou by my pen, That he gives you no affliction,\nbut he gives you a cure; you need\nnot run to Apollo, nor Æsculapius; and if\nhe was so choleric as you make him to be,\nhe would have drawn his sword for anger,\nto see the ill conditions of these people\nthat can spy his vices, and not his virtues.\nThe eternal God, when he made Mars,\nmade him for public good, and the sons of\nmen shall know it in the latter end of the\nworld. Et cælum Mars solus babet. You\nsay Mars is a destroyer; mix a little Wormwood,\nan herb of Mars, with your ink,\nneither rats nor mice touch the paper written\nwith it, and then Mars is a preserver.\nAstrologers think Mars causes scabs and\nitch, and the virgins are angry with him,\nbecause wanton Venus told them he deforms\ntheir skins; but, quoth Mars, my\nonly desire is, they should know themselves;\nmy herb Wormwood will restore them to\nthe beauty they formerly had, and in that\nI will not come an inch behind my opposite,\nVenus: for which doth the greatest evil, he\nthat takes away an innate beauty, and when\nhe has done, knows how to restore it again?\nor she that teaches a company of wanton\nlasses to paint their faces? If Mars be in\na Virgin, in the nativity, they say he causes\nthe cholic (it is well God hath set some\nbody to pull down the pride of man.) He\nin the Virgin troubles none with the cholic,\nbut them that know not themselves (for who\nknows himself, may easily know all the\nworld.) Wormwood, an herb of Mars, is a\npresent cure for it; and whether it be most\nlike a Christian to love him for his good, or\nhate him for his evil, judge ye. I had almost\nforgotten, that charity thinks no evil.\nI was once in the Tower and viewed the wardrobe,\nand there was a great many fine clothes:\n(I can give them no other title, for I was never\neither linen or woolen draper) yet as brave as\nthey looked, my opinion was that the moths\nmight consume them; moths are under the\ndominion of Mars; this herb Wormwood being\nlaid among cloaths, will make a moth\nscorn to meddle with the cloaths, as much\nas a lion scorns to meddle with a mouse, or\nan eagle with a fly. You say Mars is angry,\nand it is true enough he is angry with\nmany countrymen, for being such fools to\nbe led by the noses by the college of physicians,\nas they lead bears to Paris garden.\nMelancholy men cannot endure to be\nwronged in point of good fame, and that\ndoth sorely trouble old Saturn, because they\ncall him the greatest infortunate; in the\nbody of man he rules the spleen, (and that\nmakes covetous man so splenetic) the poor\nold man lies crying out of his left side.\nFather Saturn’s angry, Mars comes to him;\nCome, brother, I confess thou art evil spoken\nof, and so am I; thou knowest I have my\nexaltation in thy house, I give him an herb\nof mine, Wormwood, to cure the old man:\nSaturn consented, but spoke little, and so\nMars cured him by sympathy. When\nMars was free from war, (for he loves to be\nfighting, and is the best friend a soldier\nhath) I say, when Mars was free from war,\nhe called a council of war in his own brain,\nto know how he should do poor sinful man\ngood, desiring to forget his abuses in being\ncalled an infortunate. He musters up his\nown forces, and places them in battalia.\nOh! quoth he, why do I hurt a poor\nsilly man or woman? His angel answers\nhim, It is because they have offended their\nGod, (Look back to Adam:) Well, says\nMars, though they speak evil of me, I will\ndo good to them; Death’s cold, my herb\nshall heat them: they are full of ill humours\n(else they would never have spoken ill of\nme;) my herb shall cleanse them, and dry\nthem; they are poor weak creatures, my\nherb shall strengthen them; they are dull\nwitted, my herb shall fortify their apprehensions;[198]\nand yet among astrologers all\nthis does not deserve a good word: Oh the\npatience of Mars!\nFelix qui potuit rerum cognoscere caucas,\nInque domus superum scandere cura facit.\nO happy he that can the knowledge gain,\nTo know the eternal God made nought in vain.\nTo this I add,\nI know the reason causeth such a dearth\nOf knowledge; ’tis because men love the earth.\nThe other day Mars told me he met with\nVenus, and he asked her, What was the\nreason that she accused him for abusing\nwomen? He never gave them the pox. In\nthe dispute they fell out, and in anger\nparted, and Mars told me that his brother\nSaturn told him, that an antivenerean\nmedicine was the best against the pox.\nOnce a month he meets with the Moon.\nMars is quick enough of speech, and the\nMoon not much behind hand, (neither are\nmost women.) The Moon looks much\nafter children, and children are much troubled\nwith the worms; she desired a medicine\nof him, he bid her take his own herb,\nWormwood. He had no sooner parted\nwith the Moon, but he met with Venus, and\nshe was as drunk as a hog; Alas! poor\nVenus, quoth he; What! thou a fortune,\nand be drunk? I’ll give thee antipathetical\ncure; Take my herb Wormwood, and thou\nshall never get a surfeit by drinking. A\npoor silly countryman hath got an ague,\nand cannot go about his business: he\nwishes he had it not, and so do I; but I\nwill tell him a remedy, whereby he shall\nprevent it; Take the herb of Mars, Wormwood,\nand if infortunes will do good, what\nwill fortunes do? Some think the lungs are\nunder Jupiter; and if the lungs then the\nbreath; and though sometimes a man gets\na stinking breath, and yet Jupiter is a fortune,\nforsooth; up comes Mars to him;\nCome brother Jupiter, thou knowest I sent\nthee a couple of trines to thy house last\nnight, the one from Aries, and the other\nfrom Scorpio; give me thy leave by sympathy\nto cure this poor man with drinking\na draught of Wormwood beer every morning.\nThe Moon was weak the other day,\nand she gave a man two terrible mischiefs,\na dull brain and a weak sight; Mars laid\nby his sword, and comes to her; Sister\nMoon, said he, this man hath angered thee,\nbut I beseech thee take notice he is but a\nfool; prithee be patient, I will with my herb\nwormwood cure him of both infirmities by\nantipathy, for thou knowest thou and I cannot\nagree; with that the Moon began to\nquarrel; Mars (not delighting much in\nwomen’s tongues) went away, and did it\nwhether she would or no.\nHe that reads this, and understands what\nhe reads, hath a jewel of more worth than\na diamond; he that understands it not, is\nas little fit to give physick. There lies a\nkey in these words which will unlock, (if it\nbe turned by a wise hand) the cabinet of\nphysick: I have delivered it as plain as I\ndurst; it is not only upon Wormwood as\nI wrote, but upon all plants, trees, and\nherbs; he that understands it not, is unfit\n(in my opinion) to give physic. This shall\nlive when I am dead. And thus I leave it\nto the world, not caring a farthing whether\nthey like it or dislike it. The grave equals\nall men, and therefore shall equal me with\nall princes; until which time the eternal\nProvidence is over me: Then the ill tongue\nof a prating fellow, or one that hath more\ntongue than wit, or more proud than\nhonest, shall never trouble me. Wisdom is\njustified by her children. And so much for\nWormwood.\nYARROW, CALLED NOSE-BLEED, MILFOIL\nAND THOUSAND-LEAL.\nDescript.] It hath many long leaves\nspread upon the ground, finely cut, and\ndivided into many small parts. Its flowers\nare white, but not all of a whiteness and[199]\nstayed in knots, upon divers green stalks\nwhich rise from among the leaves.\nPlace.] It is frequent in all pastures.\nTime.] It flowers late, even in the latter\nend of August.\nGovernment and virtues.] It is under the\ninfluence of Venus. An ointment of them\ncures wounds, and is most fit for such as\nhave inflammations, it being an herb of\nDame Venus; it stops the terms in women,\nbeing boiled in white wine, and the decoction\ndrank; as also the bloody flux; the\nointment of it is not only good for green\nwounds, but also for ulcers and fistulas,\nespecially such as abound with moisture.\nIt stays the shedding of hair, the head being\nbathed with the decoction of it; inwardly\ntaken it helps the retentive faculty of the\nstomach: it helps the gonorrhea in men,\nand the whites in women, and helps such as\ncannot hold their water; and the leaves\nchewed in the mouth eases the tooth-ache,\nand these virtues being put together, shew\nthe herb to be drying and binding. Achilles\nis supposed to be the first that left the virtues\nof this herb to posterity, having learned\nthem of this master Chiron, the Centaur;\nand certainly a very profitable herb it is in\ncramps, and therefore called Militaris.\nDIRECTIONS FOR MAKING SYRUPS, CONSERVES,\n&c. &c.\nHaving in divers places of this Treatise\npromised you the way of making Syrups,\nConserves, Oils, Ointments, &c., of herbs,\nroots, flowers, &c. whereby you may have\nthem ready for your use at such times when\nthey cannot be had otherwise; I come now\nto perform what I promised, and you shall\nfind me rather better than worse than my\nword.\nThat this may be done methodically,\nI shall divide my directions into two grand\nsections, and each section into several chapters,\nand then you shall see it look with such\na countenance as this is.\n",

You\nsay Mars is a destroyer; mix a little Wormwood,\nan herb of Mars, with your ink,\nneither rats nor mice touch the paper written\nwith it, and then Mars is a preserver.\nAstrologers think Mars causes scabs and\nitch, and the virgins are angry with him,\nbecause wanton Venus told them he deforms\ntheir skins; but, quoth Mars, my\nonly desire is, they should know themselves;\nmy herb Wormwood will restore them to\nthe beauty they formerly had, and in that\nI will not come an inch behind my opposite,\nVenus: for which doth the greatest evil, he\nthat takes away an innate beauty, and when\nhe has done, knows how to restore it again?\nor she that teaches a company of wanton\nlasses to paint their faces? If Mars be in\na Virgin, in the nativity, they say he causes\nthe cholic (it is well God hath set some\nbody to pull down the pride of man.) He\nin the Virgin troubles none with the cholic,\nbut them that know not themselves (for who\nknows himself, may easily know all the\nworld.) Wormwood, an herb of Mars, is a\npresent cure for it; and whether it be most\nlike a Christian to love him for his good, or\nhate him for his evil, judge ye. I had almost\nforgotten, that charity thinks no evil.\nI was once in the Tower and viewed the wardrobe,\nand there was a great many fine clothes:\n(I can give them no other title, for I was never\neither linen or woolen draper) yet as brave as\nthey looked, my opinion was that the moths\nmight consume them; moths are under the\ndominion of Mars; this herb Wormwood being\nlaid among cloaths, will make a moth\nscorn to meddle with the cloaths, as much\nas a lion scorns to meddle with a mouse, or\nan eagle with a fly. You say Mars is angry,\nand it is true enough he is angry with\nmany countrymen, for being such fools to\nbe led by the noses by the college of physicians,\nas they lead bears to Paris garden.\nMelancholy men cannot endure to be\nwronged in point of good fame, and that\ndoth sorely trouble old Saturn, because they\ncall him the greatest infortunate; in the\nbody of man he rules the spleen, (and that\nmakes covetous man so splenetic) the poor\nold man lies crying out of his left side.\nFather Saturn’s angry, Mars comes to him;\nCome, brother, I confess thou art evil spoken\nof, and so am I; thou knowest I have my\nexaltation in thy house, I give him an herb\nof mine, Wormwood, to cure the old man:\nSaturn consented, but spoke little, and so\nMars cured him by sympathy. When\nMars was free from war, (for he loves to be\nfighting, and is the best friend a soldier\nhath) I say, when Mars was free from war,\nhe called a council of war in his own brain,\nto know how he should do poor sinful man\ngood, desiring to forget his abuses in being\ncalled an infortunate. He musters up his\nown forces, and places them in battalia.\nOh! quoth he, why do I hurt a poor\nsilly man or woman? His angel answers\nhim, It is because they have offended their\nGod, (Look back to Adam:) Well, says\nMars, though they speak evil of me, I will\ndo good to them; Death’s cold, my herb\nshall heat them: they are full of ill humours\n(else they would never have spoken ill of\nme;) my herb shall cleanse them, and dry\nthem; they are poor weak creatures, my\nherb shall strengthen them; they are dull\nwitted, my herb shall fortify their apprehensions;[198]\nand yet among astrologers all\nthis does not deserve a good word: Oh the\npatience of Mars!\nFelix qui potuit rerum cognoscere caucas,\nInque domus superum scandere cura facit.\nO happy he that can the knowledge gain,\nTo know the eternal God made nought in vain.\nTo this I add,\nI know the reason causeth such a dearth\nOf knowledge; ’tis because men love the earth.\nThe other day Mars told me he met with\nVenus, and he asked her, What was the\nreason that she accused him for abusing\nwomen? He never gave them the pox. In\nthe dispute they fell out, and in anger\nparted, and Mars told me that his brother\nSaturn told him, that an antivenerean\nmedicine was the best against the pox.\nOnce a month he meets with the Moon.\nMars is quick enough of speech, and the\nMoon not much behind hand, (neither are\nmost women.) The Moon looks much\nafter children, and children are much troubled\nwith the worms; she desired a medicine\nof him, he bid her take his own herb,\nWormwood. He had no sooner parted\nwith the Moon, but he met with Venus, and\nshe was as drunk as a hog; Alas! poor\nVenus, quoth he; What! thou a fortune,\nand be drunk? I’ll give thee antipathetical\ncure; Take my herb Wormwood, and thou\nshall never get a surfeit by drinking. A\npoor silly countryman hath got an ague,\nand cannot go about his business: he\nwishes he had it not, and so do I; but I\nwill tell him a remedy, whereby he shall\nprevent it; Take the herb of Mars, Wormwood,\nand if infortunes will do good, what\nwill fortunes do? Some think the lungs are\nunder Jupiter; and if the lungs then the\nbreath; and though sometimes a man gets\na stinking breath, and yet Jupiter is a fortune,\nforsooth; up comes Mars to him;\nCome brother Jupiter, thou knowest I sent\nthee a couple of trines to thy house last\nnight, the one from Aries, and the other\nfrom Scorpio; give me thy leave by sympathy\nto cure this poor man with drinking\na draught of Wormwood beer every morning.\nThe Moon was weak the other day,\nand she gave a man two terrible mischiefs,\na dull brain and a weak sight; Mars laid\nby his sword, and comes to her; Sister\nMoon, said he, this man hath angered thee,\nbut I beseech thee take notice he is but a\nfool; prithee be patient, I will with my herb\nwormwood cure him of both infirmities by\nantipathy, for thou knowest thou and I cannot\nagree; with that the Moon began to\nquarrel; Mars (not delighting much in\nwomen’s tongues) went away, and did it\nwhether she would or no.\nHe that reads this, and understands what\nhe reads, hath a jewel of more worth than\na diamond; he that understands it not, is\nas little fit to give physick. There lies a\nkey in these words which will unlock, (if it\nbe turned by a wise hand) the cabinet of\nphysick: I have delivered it as plain as I\ndurst; it is not only upon Wormwood as\nI wrote, but upon all plants, trees, and\nherbs; he that understands it not, is unfit\n(in my opinion) to give physic. This shall\nlive when I am dead. And thus I leave it\nto the world, not caring a farthing whether\nthey like it or dislike it. The grave equals\nall men, and therefore shall equal me with\nall princes; until which time the eternal\nProvidence is over me: Then the ill tongue\nof a prating fellow, or one that hath more\ntongue than wit, or more proud than\nhonest, shall never trouble me. Wisdom is\njustified by her children. And so much for\nWormwood.\nYARROW, CALLED NOSE-BLEED, MILFOIL\nAND THOUSAND-LEAL.\nDescript.] It hath many long leaves\nspread upon the ground, finely cut, and\ndivided into many small parts. Its flowers\nare white, but not all of a whiteness and[199]\nstayed in knots, upon divers green stalks\nwhich rise from among the leaves.\nPlace.] It is frequent in all pastures.\nTime.] It flowers late, even in the latter\nend of August.\nGovernment and virtues.] It is under the\ninfluence of Venus. An ointment of them\ncures wounds, and is most fit for such as\nhave inflammations, it being an herb of\nDame Venus; it stops the terms in women,\nbeing boiled in white wine, and the decoction\ndrank; as also the bloody flux; the\nointment of it is not only good for green\nwounds, but also for ulcers and fistulas,\nespecially such as abound with moisture.\nIt stays the shedding of hair, the head being\nbathed with the decoction of it; inwardly\ntaken it helps the retentive faculty of the\nstomach: it helps the gonorrhea in men,\nand the whites in women, and helps such as\ncannot hold their water; and the leaves\nchewed in the mouth eases the tooth-ache,\nand these virtues being put together, shew\nthe herb to be drying and binding. Achilles\nis supposed to be the first that left the virtues\nof this herb to posterity, having learned\nthem of this master Chiron, the Centaur;\nand certainly a very profitable herb it is in\ncramps, and therefore called Militaris.\nDIRECTIONS FOR MAKING SYRUPS, CONSERVES,\n&c. &c.\nHaving in divers places of this Treatise\npromised you the way of making Syrups,\nConserves, Oils, Ointments, &c., of herbs,\nroots, flowers, &c. whereby you may have\nthem ready for your use at such times when\nthey cannot be had otherwise; I come now\nto perform what I promised, and you shall\nfind me rather better than worse than my\nword.\nThat this may be done methodically,\nI shall divide my directions into two grand\nsections, and each section into several chapters,\nand then you shall see it look with such\na countenance as this is."

It is better to keep them whole than\nbeaten; for being beaten, they are more\nsubject to lose their strength; because the\nair soon penetrates them.\n3. If they be not dry enough to beat into\npowder when you need them, dry them by\na gentle fire till they are so.\n4. Having beaten them, sift them through\na fine tiffany searce, that no great pieces\nmay be found in your electuary.\n5. To one ounce of your powder add\nthree ounces of clarified honey; this quantity\nI hold to be sufficient. If you would\nmake more or less electuary, vary your proportion\naccordingly.\n6. Mix them well together in a mortar,\nand take this for a truth, you cannot mix\nthem too much.\n7. The way to clarify honey, is to set it\nover the fire in a convenient vessel, till the\nscum rise, and when the scum is taken off,\nit is clarified.\n8. The usual dose of cordial electuaries,\nis from half a dram to two drams; of purging\nelectuaries, from half an ounce to an\nounce.\n9. The manner of keeping them is in a\npot.\n10. The time of taking them, is either in\na morning fasting, and fasting an hour after\nthem; or at night going to bed, three or four\nhours after supper."

If I should tell you here a long tale of\nmedicine working by sympathy and antipathy,\nyou would not understand a word of\nit: They that are set to make physicians\nmay find it in the treatise. All modern\nphysicians know not what belongs to a\nsympathetical cure, no more than a cuckow\nwhat belongs to flats and sharps in music,\nbut follow the vulgar road, and call it a\nhidden quality, because ’tis hidden from the\neyes of dunces, and indeed none but astrologers\ncan give a reason for it; and physic\nwithout reason is like a pudding without\nfat.\n5. The way to make pills is very easy,\nfor with the help of a pestle and mortar,\nand a little diligence, you may make any\npowder into pills, either with syrup, or the\njelly I told you before."

    "full_text": "FAMILY DISPENSATORY.\nAN ASTROLOGO-PHYSICAL DISCOURSE OF THE HUMAN VIRTUES IN\nTHE BODY OF MAN; BOTH PRINCIPAL AND ADMINISTERING.\nHuman virtues are either PRINCIPAL\nfor procreation, and conservation; or ADMINISTRING,\nfor Attraction, Digestion,\nRetention, or Expulsion.\nVirtues conservative, are Vital, Natural,\nand Animal.\nBy the natural are bred Blood, Choler,\nFlegm, and Melancholy.\nThe animal virtue is Intellective, and Sensitive.\nThe Intellective is Imagination, Judgment,\nand Memory.\nThe sensitive is Common, and Particular.\nThe particular is Seeing, Hearing, Smelling,\nTasting, and Feeling.\nThe scope of this discourse is, To preserve\nin soundness and vigour, the mind\nand understanding of man; to strengthen\nthe brain, preserve the body in health, to\nteach a man to be an able co-artificer, or\nhelper of nature, to withstand and expel\nDiseases.\nI shall touch only the principal faculties\nboth of body and mind; which being kept\nin a due decorum, preserve the body in\nhealth, and the mind in vigour.\nI shall in this place speak of them only\nin the general, as they are laid down to\nyour view in the Synopsis, in the former\npages, and in the same order.\nVirtue Procreative.] The first in order, is[212]\nthe Virtue Procreative: for natural regards\nnot only the conservation of itself, but to\nbeget its like, and conserve in Species.\nThe seat of this is the Member of Generation,\nand is governed principally by the\ninfluence of Venus.\nIt is augmented and encreased by the\nstrength of Venus, by her Herbs, Roots,\nTrees, Minerals, &c.\nIt is diminished and purged by those of\nMars, and quite extinguished by those of\nSaturn.\nObserve the hour and Medicines of Venus,\nto fortify; of Mars, to cleanse this virtue;\nof Saturn, to extinguish it.\nConservative.] The conservative virtue is\nVital, Natural, Animal.\nVital.] The Vital spirit hath its residence\nin the heart, and is dispersed from it by the\nArteries; and is governed by the influence\nof the Sun. And it is to the body, as the\nSun is to the Creation; as the heart is in\nthe Microcosm, so is the Sun in the Megacosm:\nfor as the Sun gives life, light, and\nmotion to the Creation, so doth the heart to\nthe body; therefore it is called Sol Corporis,\nas the Sun is called Cor Cœli, because their\noperations are similar.\nInimical and destructive to this virtue,\nare Saturn and Mars.\nThe Herbs and Plants of Sol, wonderfully\nfortify it.\nNatural.] The natural faculty or virtue\nresides in the liver, and is generally governed\nby Jupiter, Quasi Juvans Pater; its office is\nto nourish the body, and is dispersed through\nthe body by the veins.\nFrom this are bred four particular\nhumours, Blood, Choler, Flegm, and Melancholy.\nBlood is made of meat perfectly concocted,\nin quality hot and moist, governed\nby Jupiter: It is by a third concoction\ntransmuted into flesh, the superfluity of it\ninto seed, and its receptacle is the veins, by\nwhich it is dispersed through the body.\nCholer is made of meat more than perfectly\nconcocted; and it is the spume or\nfroth of blood: it clarifies all the humours,\nheats the body, nourishes the apprehension,\nas blood doth the judgment: It is in quality\nhot and dry; fortifies the attractive faculty,\nas blood doth the digestive; moves man to\nactivity and valour: its receptacle is the\ngall, and it is under the influence of Mars.\nFlegm is made of meat not perfectly digested;\nit fortifies the virtue expulsive, makes\nthe body slippery, fit for ejection; it fortifies\nthe brain by its consimilitude with it; yet\nit spoils apprehension by its antipathy to it:\nIt qualifies choler, cools and moistens the\nheart, thereby sustaining it, and the whole\nbody, from the fiery effects, which continual\nmotion would produce. Its receptacle is\nthe lungs, and is governed by Venus, some\nsay by the Moon, perhaps it may be governed\nby them both, it is cold and moist in\nquality.\nMelancholy is the sediment of blood, cold\nand dry in quality, fortifying the retentive\nfaculty, and memory; makes men sober,\nsolid, and staid, fit for study; stays the unbridled\ntoys of lustful blood, stays the wandering\nthoughts, and reduces them home to\nthe centre: its receptacle is in the spleen,\nand it is governed by Saturn.\nOf all these humours blood is the chief,\nall the rest are superfluities of blood; yet\nare they necessary superfluities, for without\nany of them, man cannot live.\nNamely; Choler is the fiery superfluities;\nFlegm, the Watery; Melancholy, the\nEarthly.\nAnimal.] The third principal virtue remains,\nwhich is Animal; its residence is in\nthe brain, and Mercury is the general significator\nof it. Ptolomy held the Moon signified\nthe Animal virtue; and I am of\nopinion, both Mercury and the Moon dispose\nit; and my reason is, 1, Because both\nof them in nativities, either fortify, or impedite\nit. 2, Ill directions to either, or from eithe[213]r,\nafflict it, as good ones help it. Indeed the\nMoon rules the bulk of it, as also the sensitive\npart of it: Mercury the rational part:\nand that’s the reason, if in a nativity the\nMoon be stronger than Mercury, sense many\ntimes over-powers reason; but if Mercury\nbe strong, and the Moon weak, reason will\nbe master ordinarily in despite of sense.\nIt is divided into Intellective, and Sensitive.\n1. Intellective.] The Intellectual resides\nin the brain, within the Pia mater, is governed\ngenerally by Mercury.\nIt is divided into Imagination, Judgment,\nand Memory.\nImagination is seated in the forepart of\nthe brain; it is hot and dry in quality,\nquick, active, always working; it receives\nvapours from the heart, and coins them into\nthoughts: it never sleeps, but always is\nworking, both when the man is sleeping and\nwaking; only when Judgment is awake it\nregulates the Imagination, which runs at\nrandom when Judgment is asleep, and forms\nany thought according to the nature of the\nvapour sent up to it. Mercury is out of\nquestion the disposer of it.\nA man may easily perceive his Judgment\nasleep before himself many times, and\nthen he shall perceive his thoughts run at\nrandom.\nJudgment always sleeps when men do,\nImagination never sleeps; Memory sometimes\nsleeps when men sleep, and sometimes\nit doth not: so then when memory is awake,\nand the man asleep, then memory remembers\nwhat apprehension coins, and that is a\ndream: The thoughts would have been the\nsame, if memory had not been awake to remember\nit.\nThese thoughts are commonly (I mean in\nsleep, when they are purely natural,) framed\naccording to the nature of the humour,\ncalled complexion, which is predominate in\nthe body; and if the humour be peccant it\nis always so.\nSo that it is one of the surest rules to\nknow a man’s own complexion, by his\ndreams, I mean a man void of distractions,\nor deep studies: (this most assuredly shews\nMercury to dispose of the Imagination, as\nalso because it is mutable, applying itself to\nany object, as Mercury’s nature is to do;) for\nthen the imagination will follow its old bent;\nfor if a man be bent upon a business, his\napprehension will work as much when he is\nasleep, and find out as many truths by study,\nas when the man is awake; and perhaps\nmore too, because then it is not hindered\nby ocular objects.\nAnd thus much for imagination, which is\ngoverned by Mercury, and fortified by his\ninfluence; and is also strong or weak in\nman, according as Mercury is strong or\nweak in the nativity.\nJudgment is seated in the midst of the\nbrain, to shew that it ought to bear rule over\nall the other faculties: it is the judge of the\nlittle world, to approve of what is good,\nand reject what is bad; it is the seat of\nreason, and the guide of actions; so that all\nfailings are committed through its infirmity,\nit not rightly judging between a real and\nan apparent good. It is hot and moist\nin quality, and under the influence of\nJupiter.\nMemory is seated in the hinder cell of the\nbrain, it is the great register to the little\nworld; and its office is to record things\neither done and past, or to be done.\nIt is in quality cold and dry, melancholic,\nand therefore generally melancholic men\nhave best memories, and most tenacious\nevery way. It is under the dominion of\nSaturn, and is fortified by his influence, but\npurged by the luminaries.\n2. Sensitive.] The second part of the animal\nvirtue, is sensitive, and it is divided into\ntwo parts, common and particular.\nCommon sense is an imaginary term,\nand that which gives virtue to all the particular\nsenses, and knits and unites them[214]\ntogether within the Pia Mater. It is regulated\nby Mercury, (perhaps this is one reason\nwhy men are so fickle-headed) and its\noffice is to preserve a harmony among the\nsenses.\nParticular senses are five, viz. seeing,\nhearing, smelling, tasting, and feeling.\nThese senses are united in one, in the\nbrain, by the common sense, but are operatively\ndistinguished into their several\nseats, and places of residence.\nThe sight resides in the eyes, and particularly\nin the christaline humour. It is\nin quality cold and moist, and governed by\nthe luminaries. They who have them weak\nin their genesis, have always weak sights;\nif one of them be so, the weakness possesses\nbut one eye.\nThe hearing resides in the ears; is in\nquality, cold and dry, melancholy, and\nunder the dominion of Saturn.\nThe smelling resides in the nose, is in\nquality hot and dry, choleric, and that is\nthe reason choleric creatures have so good\nsmells, as dogs. It is under the influence\nof Mars.\nThe taste resides in the palate, which is\nplaced at the root of the tongue on purpose\nto discern what food is congruous for the\nstomach, and what not; as the meseraik\nveins are placed to discern what nourishment\nis proper for the liver to convert into\nblood. In some very few men, and but\na few, and in those few, but in few instances\nthese two tasters agree not, and that is the\nreason some men covet meats that make\nthem sick, viz. the taste craves them, and\nthe meseraik veins reject them: In quality\nhot and moist, and is ruled by Jupiter.\nThe feeling is deputed to no particular\norgan, but is spread abroad, over the whole\nbody; is of all qualities, hot, cold, dry, and\nmoist, and is the index of all tangible\nthings; for if it were only hot alone, it\ncould not feel a quality contrary, viz. cold,\nand this might be spoken of other qualities.\nIt is under the dominion of Venus, some say,\nMercury: A thousand to one, but it is\nunder Mercury.\nThe four ADMINISTERING VIRTUES are,\nattractive, digestive, retentive, and expulsive.\nThe attractive virtue is hot and dry, hot\nby quality, active, or principal, and that\nappears because the fountain of all heat is\nattractive, viz. the sun. Dry by a quality\npassive, or an effect of its heat; its office\nis to remain in the body, and call for what\nnature wants.\nIt is under the influence of the Sun, say\nauthors, and not under Mars, because he is\nof a corrupting nature, yet if we cast an\nimpartial eye upon experience, we shall\nfind, that martial men call for meat none of\nthe least, and for drink the most of all other\nmen, although many times they corrupt the\nbody by it, and therefore I see no reason\nwhy Mars being of the same quality with\nthe Sun, should not have a share in the\ndominion. It is in vain to object, that the\ninfluence of Mars is evil, and therefore he\nshould have no dominion over this virtue;\nfor then,\n1. By the same rule, he should have no\ndominion at all in the body of man.\n2. All the virtues in man are naturally\nevil, and corrupted by Adam’s fall.\nThis attractive virtue ought to be fortified\nwhen the Moon is in fiery signs, viz.\nAries and Sagitary, but not in Leo, for the\nsign is so violent, that no physic ought to\nbe given when the Moon is there: (and\nwhy not Leo, seeing that is the most attractive\nsign of all; and that’s the reason such\nas have it ascending in their genesis, are\nsuch greedy eaters.) If you cannot stay till\nthe Moon be in one of them, let one of them\nascend when you administer the medicine.\nThe digestive virtue is hot and moist, and\nis the principal of them all, the other like\nhandmaids attend it.\nThe attractive virtue draws that which it[215]\nshould digest, and serves continually to feed\nand supply it.\nThe retentive virtue, retains the substance\nwith it, till it be perfectly digested.\nThe expulsive virtue casteth out, expels\nwhat is superfluous by digestion. It is\nunder the influence of Jupiter, and fortified\nby his herbs and plants, &c. In fortifying\nit, let your Moon be in Gemini, Aquary, or\nthe first half of Libra, or if matters be come\nto that extremity, that you cannot stay till\nthat time, let one of them ascend, but both\nof them together would do better, always\nprovided that the Moon be not in the ascendent.\nI cannot believe the Moon afflicts\nthe ascendent so much as they talk of, if\nshe be well dignified, and in a sign she\ndelights in.\nThe retentive virtue is in quality cold and\ndry; cold, because the nature of cold is to\ncompress, witness the ice; dry, because the\nnature of dryness, is to keep and hold what\nis compressed. It is under the influence of\nSaturn, and that is the reason why usually\nSaturnine men are so covetous and tenacious.\nIn fortifying of it, make use of the\nherbs and plants, &c. of Saturn, and let the\nMoon be in Taurus or Virgo, Capricorn is not\nso good, say authors, (I can give no reason\nfor that neither;) let not Saturn nor his ill\naspect molest the ascendent.\nThe expulsive faculty is cold and moist;\ncold because that compasses the superfluities;\nmoist, because that makes the body\nslippery and fit for ejection, and disposes it\nto it. It is under the dominion of Luna,\nwith whom you may join Venus, because\nshe is of the same nature.\nAlso in whatsoever is before written, of\nthe nature of the planets, take notice, that\nfixed stars of the same nature, work the\nsame effect.\nIn fortifying this, (which ought to be\ndone in all purgations,) let the Moon be in\nCancer, Scorpio, or Pisces, or let one of these\nsigns ascend.\nAlthough I did what I could throughout\nthe whole book to express myself in such a\nlanguage as might be understood by all, and\ntherefore avoided terms of art as much as\nmight be, Yet, 1. Some words of necessity fall\nin which need explanation. 2. It would be\nvery tedious at the end of every receipt to repeat\nover and over again, the way of administration\nof the receipt, or ordering your bodies after it,\nor to instruct you in the mixture of medicines,\nand indeed would do nothing else but stuff the\nbook full of tautology.\nTo answer to both these is my task at this\ntime.\nTo the first: The words which need explaining,\nsuch as are obvious to my eye, are\nthese that follow.\n1. To distil in Balneo Mariæ, is the usual\nway of distilling in water. It is no more than\nto place your glass body which holds the matter\nto be distilled in a convenient vessel of water,\nwhen the water is cold (for fear of breaking)\nput a wisp of straw, or the like under it, to keep\nit from the bottom, then make the water boil,\nthat so the spirit may be distilled forth; take\nnot the glass out till the water be cold again,\nfor fear of breaking: It is impossible for a\nman to learn how to do it, unless he saw it\ndone.\n2. Manica Hippocrates, Hippocrates’s\nsleeve, is a piece of woolen cloth, new and\nwhite, sewed together in form of a sugar-loaf.\nIts use is, to strain any syrup or decoction\nthrough, by pouring it into it, and suffering\nit to run through without pressing or crushing\nit.\n3. Calcination, is a burning of a thing in\na crucible or other such convenient vessel\nthat will endure the fire. A crucible is such\na thing as goldsmiths melt silver in, and\nfounders metals; you may place it in the\nmidst of the fire, with coals above, below,\nand on every side of it.\n4. Filtrition, is straining of a liquid body\nthrough a brown paper: make up the paper\nin form of a funnel, the which having placed[216]\nin a funnel, and the funnel and the paper\nin it in an empty glass, pour in the liquor\nyou would filter, and let it run through at its\nleisure.\n5. Coagulation, is curdling or hardening:\nit is used in physic for reducing a liquid\nbody to hardness by the heat of the fire.\n6. Whereas you find vital, natural, and\nanimal spirits often mentioned in the virtues\nor receipts, I shall explain what they be,\nand what their operation is in the body of\nman.\nThe actions or operations of the animal\nvirtues, are, 1. sensitive, 2. motive.\nThe sensitive is, 1. external, 2. internal.\nThe external senses are, 1. seeing, 2. hearing,\n3. tasting, 4. smelling, 5. feeling.\nThe internal senses are, 1. the Imagination,\nto apprehend a thing. 2. Judgment, to judge\nof it. 3. Memory, to remember it.\nThe seat of all these is in the brain.\nThe vital spirits proceed from the heart,\nand cause in man mirth, joy, hope, trust,\nhumanity, mildness, courage, &c. and their\nopposite: viz. sadness, fear, care, sorrow,\ndespair, envy, hatred, stubbornness, revenge, &c.\nby heat natural or not natural.\nThe natural spirit nourishes the body\nthroughout (as the vital quickens it, and the\nanimal gives it sense and motion) its office\nis to alter or concoct food into chile, chile\ninto blood, blood into flesh, to form, engender,\nnourish, and increase the body.\n7. Infusion, is to steep a gross body into\none more liquid.\n8. Decoction, is the liquor in which any\nthing is boiled.\nAs for the manner of using or ordering\nthe body after any sweating, or purging\nmedicines, or pills, or the like, they will be\nfound in different parts of the work, as also\nin the next page.\nThe different forms of making up medicines,\nas some into syrups, others into electuaries,\npills, troches, &c. was partly to\nplease the different palates of people, that\nso medicines might be more delightful, or at\nleast less burdensome. You may make the\nmixtures of them in what form you please,\nonly for your better instruction at present,\naccept of these few lines.\n1. Consider, that all diseases are cured by\ntheir contraries, but all parts of the body\nmaintained by their likes: then if heat be\nthe cause of the disease, give the cold medicine\nappropriated to it; if wind, see how\nmany medicines appropriated to that disease\nexpel wind, and use them.\n2. Have a care you use not such medicines\nto one part of your body which are\nappropriated to another, for if your brain\nbe over heated, and you use such medicines\nas cool the heart or liver, you may make\nbad work.\n3. The distilled water of any herb you\nwould take for a disease, is a fit mixture\nfor the syrup of the same herb, or to make\nany electuary into a drink, if you affect\nsuch liquid medicines best; if you have not\nthe distilled water, make use of the decoction.\n4. Diseases that lie in the parts of the\nbody remote from the stomach and bowels,\nit is in vain to think to carry away the cause\nat once, and therefore you had best do it by\ndegrees; pills, and such like medicines which\nare hard in the body, are fittest for such a\nbusiness, because they are longest before\nthey digest.\n5. Use no strong medicines, if weak will\nserve the turn, you had better take one too\nweak by half, than too strong in the least.\n6. Consider the natural temper of the part\nof the body afflicted, and maintain it in that,\nelse you extinguish nature, as the heart is\nhot, the brain cold, or at least the coldest\npart of the body.\n7. Observe this general rule; That such\nmedicines as are hot in the first degree are\nmost habitual to our bodies, because they\nare just of the heat of our blood.\n8. All opening medicines, and such as[217]\nprovoke urine or the menses, or break the\nstone, may most conveniently be given in\nwhite wine, because white wine of itself is\nof an opening nature, and cleanses the\nveins.\n9. Let all such medicines as are taken\nto stop fluxes or looseness, be taken before\nmeat, about an hour before, more or less,\nthat so they may strengthen the digestion\nand retentive faculty, before the food come\ninto the stomach, but such as are subject to\nvomit up their meat, let them take such\nmedicines as stay vomiting presently after\nmeat, at the conclusion of their meals, that\nso they may close up the mouth of the\nstomach; and that is the reason why usually\nmen eat a bit of cheese after meat, because\nby its sourness and binding it closes the\nmouth of the stomach, thereby staying\nbelching and vomiting.\n10. In taking purges be very careful, and\nthat you may be so, observe these rules.\n(1.) Consider what the humour offending\nis, and let the medicine be such as purges\nthat humour, else you will weaken nature,\nnot the disease.\n(2.) Take notice, if the humour you would\npurge out be thin, then gentle medicines will\nserve the turn, but if it be tough and viscous,\nthen such medicines as are cutting and\nopening, the night before you would take\nthe purge.\n(3.) In purging tough humours, forbear as\nmuch as may be such medicines as leave a\nbinding quality behind them.\n(4.) Have a care of taking purges when\nyour body is astringent; your best way, is\nfirst to open it by a clyster.\n(5.) In taking opening medicines, you\nmay safely take them at night, eating but\na little supper three or four hours before,\nand the next morning drinking a draught of\nwarm posset-drink, and you need not fear\nto go about your business. In this manner\nyou may take Lenitive Electuary, Diacatholicon,\nPulp of Cassia, and the like gentle\nelectuaries, as also all pills that have neither\nDiagrydium nor Colocynthus, in them. But\nall violent purges require a due ordering of\nthe body; such ought to be taken in the\nmorning after you are up, and not to sleep\nafter them before they are done working, at\nleast before night: two hours after you have\ntaken them, drink a draught of warm posset-drink,\nor broth, and six hours after eat a\nbit of mutton, often walking about the\nchamber; let there be a good fire in the\nchamber, and stir not out of the chamber\ntill the purge have done working, or not till\nnext day.\nLastly, Take sweating medicines when\nyou are in bed, covered warm, and in the\ntime of your sweating drink posset-drink as\nhot as you can. If you sweat for a fever, boil\nsorrel and red sage in your posset-drink,\nsweat an hour or longer if your strength will\npermit, then (the chamber being kept very\nwarm) shift yourself all but your head, about\nwhich (the cap which you sweat in being\nstill kept on) wrap a napkin very hot, to\nrepel the vapours back.\nI confess these, or many of these directions\nmay be found in one place of the\nbook or other, and I delight as little to write\ntautology as another, but considering it\nmight make for the public good, I inserted\nthem in this place: if, notwithstanding, any\nwill be so mad as to do themselves a mischief,\nthe fault is not mine.\n",
    "cleaned_text": "FAMILY DISPENSATORY.\nAN ASTROLOGO-PHYSICAL DISCOURSE OF THE HUMAN VIRTUES IN\nTHE BODY OF MAN; BOTH PRINCIPAL AND ADMINISTERING.\nHuman virtues are either PRINCIPAL\nfor procreation, and conservation; or ADMINISTRING,\nfor Attraction, Digestion,\nRetention, or Expulsion.\nVirtues conservative, are Vital, Natural,\nand Animal.\nBy the natural are bred Blood, Choler,\nFlegm, and Melancholy.\nThe animal virtue is Intellective, and Sensitive.\nThe Intellective is Imagination, Judgment,\nand Memory.\nThe sensitive is Common, and Particular.\nThe particular is Seeing, Hearing, Smelling,\nTasting, and Feeling.\nThe scope of this discourse is, To preserve\nin soundness and vigour, the mind\nand understanding of man; to strengthen\nthe brain, preserve the body in health, to\nteach a man to be an able co-artificer, or\nhelper of nature, to withstand and expel\nDiseases.\nI shall touch only the principal faculties\nboth of body and mind; which being kept\nin a due decorum, preserve the body in\nhealth, and the mind in vigour.\nI shall in this place speak of them only\nin the general, as they are laid down to\nyour view in the Synopsis, in the former\npages, and in the same order.\nVirtue Procreative.] The first in order, is[212]\nthe Virtue Procreative: for natural regards\nnot only the conservation of itself, but to\nbeget its like, and conserve in Species.\nThe seat of this is the Member of Generation,\nand is governed principally by the\ninfluence of Venus.\nIt is augmented and encreased by the\nstrength of Venus, by her Herbs, Roots,\nTrees, Minerals, &c.\nIt is diminished and purged by those of\nMars, and quite extinguished by those of\nSaturn.\nObserve the hour and Medicines of Venus,\nto fortify; of Mars, to cleanse this virtue;\nof Saturn, to extinguish it.\nConservative.] The conservative virtue is\nVital, Natural, Animal.\nVital.] The Vital spirit hath its residence\nin the heart, and is dispersed from it by the\nArteries; and is governed by the influence\nof the Sun. And it is to the body, as the\nSun is to the Creation; as the heart is in\nthe Microcosm, so is the Sun in the Megacosm:\nfor as the Sun gives life, light, and\nmotion to the Creation, so doth the heart to\nthe body; therefore it is called Sol Corporis,\nas the Sun is called Cor Cœli, because their\noperations are similar.\nInimical and destructive to this virtue,\nare Saturn and Mars.\nThe Herbs and Plants of Sol, wonderfully\nfortify it.\nNatural.] The natural faculty or virtue\nresides in the liver, and is generally governed\nby Jupiter, Quasi Juvans Pater; its office is\nto nourish the body, and is dispersed through\nthe body by the veins.\nFrom this are bred four particular\nhumours, Blood, Choler, Flegm, and Melancholy.\nBlood is made of meat perfectly concocted,\nin quality hot and moist, governed\nby Jupiter: It is by a third concoction\ntransmuted into flesh, the superfluity of it\ninto seed, and its receptacle is the veins, by\nwhich it is dispersed through the body.\nCholer is made of meat more than perfectly\nconcocted; and it is the spume or\nfroth of blood: it clarifies all the humours,\nheats the body, nourishes the apprehension,\nas blood doth the judgment: It is in quality\nhot and dry; fortifies the attractive faculty,\nas blood doth the digestive; moves man to\nactivity and valour: its receptacle is the\ngall, and it is under the influence of Mars.\nFlegm is made of meat not perfectly digested;\nit fortifies the virtue expulsive, makes\nthe body slippery, fit for ejection; it fortifies\nthe brain by its consimilitude with it; yet\nit spoils apprehension by its antipathy to it:\nIt qualifies choler, cools and moistens the\nheart, thereby sustaining it, and the whole\nbody, from the fiery effects, which continual\nmotion would produce. Its receptacle is\nthe lungs, and is governed by Venus, some\nsay by the Moon, perhaps it may be governed\nby them both, it is cold and moist in\nquality.\nMelancholy is the sediment of blood, cold\nand dry in quality, fortifying the retentive\nfaculty, and memory; makes men sober,\nsolid, and staid, fit for study; stays the unbridled\ntoys of lustful blood, stays the wandering\nthoughts, and reduces them home to\nthe centre: its receptacle is in the spleen,\nand it is governed by Saturn.\nOf all these humours blood is the chief,\nall the rest are superfluities of blood; yet\nare they necessary superfluities, for without\nany of them, man cannot live.\nNamely; Choler is the fiery superfluities;\nFlegm, the Watery; Melancholy, the\nEarthly.\nAnimal.] The third principal virtue remains,\nwhich is Animal; its residence is in\nthe brain, and Mercury is the general significator\nof it. Ptolomy held the Moon signified\nthe Animal virtue; and I am of\nopinion, both Mercury and the Moon dispose\nit; and my reason is, 1, Because both\nof them in nativities, either fortify, or impedite\nit. 2, Ill directions to either, or from eithe[213]r,\nafflict it, as good ones help it. Indeed the\nMoon rules the bulk of it, as also the sensitive\npart of it: Mercury the rational part:\nand that’s the reason, if in a nativity the\nMoon be stronger than Mercury, sense many\ntimes over-powers reason; but if Mercury\nbe strong, and the Moon weak, reason will\nbe master ordinarily in despite of sense.\nIt is divided into Intellective, and Sensitive.\n1. Intellective.] The Intellectual resides\nin the brain, within the Pia mater, is governed\ngenerally by Mercury.\nIt is divided into Imagination, Judgment,\nand Memory.\nImagination is seated in the forepart of\nthe brain; it is hot and dry in quality,\nquick, active, always working; it receives\nvapours from the heart, and coins them into\nthoughts: it never sleeps, but always is\nworking, both when the man is sleeping and\nwaking; only when Judgment is awake it\nregulates the Imagination, which runs at\nrandom when Judgment is asleep, and forms\nany thought according to the nature of the\nvapour sent up to it. Mercury is out of\nquestion the disposer of it.\nA man may easily perceive his Judgment\nasleep before himself many times, and\nthen he shall perceive his thoughts run at\nrandom.\nJudgment always sleeps when men do,\nImagination never sleeps; Memory sometimes\nsleeps when men sleep, and sometimes\nit doth not: so then when memory is awake,\nand the man asleep, then memory remembers\nwhat apprehension coins, and that is a\ndream: The thoughts would have been the\nsame, if memory had not been awake to remember\nit.\nThese thoughts are commonly (I mean in\nsleep, when they are purely natural,) framed\naccording to the nature of the humour,\ncalled complexion, which is predominate in\nthe body; and if the humour be peccant it\nis always so.\nSo that it is one of the surest rules to\nknow a man’s own complexion, by his\ndreams, I mean a man void of distractions,\nor deep studies: (this most assuredly shews\nMercury to dispose of the Imagination, as\nalso because it is mutable, applying itself to\nany object, as Mercury’s nature is to do;) for\nthen the imagination will follow its old bent;\nfor if a man be bent upon a business, his\napprehension will work as much when he is\nasleep, and find out as many truths by study,\nas when the man is awake; and perhaps\nmore too, because then it is not hindered\nby ocular objects.\nAnd thus much for imagination, which is\ngoverned by Mercury, and fortified by his\ninfluence; and is also strong or weak in\nman, according as Mercury is strong or\nweak in the nativity.\nJudgment is seated in the midst of the\nbrain, to shew that it ought to bear rule over\nall the other faculties: it is the judge of the\nlittle world, to approve of what is good,\nand reject what is bad; it is the seat of\nreason, and the guide of actions; so that all\nfailings are committed through its infirmity,\nit not rightly judging between a real and\nan apparent good. It is hot and moist\nin quality, and under the influence of\nJupiter.\nMemory is seated in the hinder cell of the\nbrain, it is the great register to the little\nworld; and its office is to record things\neither done and past, or to be done.\nIt is in quality cold and dry, melancholic,\nand therefore generally melancholic men\nhave best memories, and most tenacious\nevery way. It is under the dominion of\nSaturn, and is fortified by his influence, but\npurged by the luminaries.\n2. Sensitive.] The second part of the animal\nvirtue, is sensitive, and it is divided into\ntwo parts, common and particular.\nCommon sense is an imaginary term,\nand that which gives virtue to all the particular\nsenses, and knits and unites them[214]\ntogether within the Pia Mater. It is regulated\nby Mercury, (perhaps this is one reason\nwhy men are so fickle-headed) and its\noffice is to preserve a harmony among the\nsenses.\nParticular senses are five, viz. seeing,\nhearing, smelling, tasting, and feeling.\nThese senses are united in one, in the\nbrain, by the common sense, but are operatively\ndistinguished into their several\nseats, and places of residence.\nThe sight resides in the eyes, and particularly\nin the christaline humour. It is\nin quality cold and moist, and governed by\nthe luminaries. They who have them weak\nin their genesis, have always weak sights;\nif one of them be so, the weakness possesses\nbut one eye.\nThe hearing resides in the ears; is in\nquality, cold and dry, melancholy, and\nunder the dominion of Saturn.\nThe smelling resides in the nose, is in\nquality hot and dry, choleric, and that is\nthe reason choleric creatures have so good\nsmells, as dogs. It is under the influence\nof Mars.\nThe taste resides in the palate, which is\nplaced at the root of the tongue on purpose\nto discern what food is congruous for the\nstomach, and what not; as the meseraik\nveins are placed to discern what nourishment\nis proper for the liver to convert into\nblood. In some very few men, and but\na few, and in those few, but in few instances\nthese two tasters agree not, and that is the\nreason some men covet meats that make\nthem sick, viz. the taste craves them, and\nthe meseraik veins reject them: In quality\nhot and moist, and is ruled by Jupiter.\nThe feeling is deputed to no particular\norgan, but is spread abroad, over the whole\nbody; is of all qualities, hot, cold, dry, and\nmoist, and is the index of all tangible\nthings; for if it were only hot alone, it\ncould not feel a quality contrary, viz. cold,\nand this might be spoken of other qualities.\nIt is under the dominion of Venus, some say,\nMercury: A thousand to one, but it is\nunder Mercury.\nThe four ADMINISTERING VIRTUES are,\nattractive, digestive, retentive, and expulsive.\nThe attractive virtue is hot and dry, hot\nby quality, active, or principal, and that\nappears because the fountain of all heat is\nattractive, viz. the sun. Dry by a quality\npassive, or an effect of its heat; its office\nis to remain in the body, and call for what\nnature wants.\nIt is under the influence of the Sun, say\nauthors, and not under Mars, because he is\nof a corrupting nature, yet if we cast an\nimpartial eye upon experience, we shall\nfind, that martial men call for meat none of\nthe least, and for drink the most of all other\nmen, although many times they corrupt the\nbody by it, and therefore I see no reason\nwhy Mars being of the same quality with\nthe Sun, should not have a share in the\ndominion. It is in vain to object, that the\ninfluence of Mars is evil, and therefore he\nshould have no dominion over this virtue;\nfor then,\n1. By the same rule, he should have no\ndominion at all in the body of man.\n2. All the virtues in man are naturally\nevil, and corrupted by Adam’s fall.\nThis attractive virtue ought to be fortified\nwhen the Moon is in fiery signs, viz.\nAries and Sagitary, but not in Leo, for the\nsign is so violent, that no physic ought to\nbe given when the Moon is there: (and\nwhy not Leo, seeing that is the most attractive\nsign of all; and that’s the reason such\nas have it ascending in their genesis, are\nsuch greedy eaters.) If you cannot stay till\nthe Moon be in one of them, let one of them\nascend when you administer the medicine.\nThe digestive virtue is hot and moist, and\nis the principal of them all, the other like\nhandmaids attend it.\nThe attractive virtue draws that which it[215]\nshould digest, and serves continually to feed\nand supply it.\nThe retentive virtue, retains the substance\nwith it, till it be perfectly digested.\nThe expulsive virtue casteth out, expels\nwhat is superfluous by digestion. It is\nunder the influence of Jupiter, and fortified\nby his herbs and plants, &c. In fortifying\nit, let your Moon be in Gemini, Aquary, or\nthe first half of Libra, or if matters be come\nto that extremity, that you cannot stay till\nthat time, let one of them ascend, but both\nof them together would do better, always\nprovided that the Moon be not in the ascendent.\nI cannot believe the Moon afflicts\nthe ascendent so much as they talk of, if\nshe be well dignified, and in a sign she\ndelights in.\nThe retentive virtue is in quality cold and\ndry; cold, because the nature of cold is to\ncompress, witness the ice; dry, because the\nnature of dryness, is to keep and hold what\nis compressed. It is under the influence of\nSaturn, and that is the reason why usually\nSaturnine men are so covetous and tenacious.\nIn fortifying of it, make use of the\nherbs and plants, &c. of Saturn, and let the\nMoon be in Taurus or Virgo, Capricorn is not\nso good, say authors, (I can give no reason\nfor that neither;) let not Saturn nor his ill\naspect molest the ascendent.\nThe expulsive faculty is cold and moist;\ncold because that compasses the superfluities;\nmoist, because that makes the body\nslippery and fit for ejection, and disposes it\nto it. It is under the dominion of Luna,\nwith whom you may join Venus, because\nshe is of the same nature.\nAlso in whatsoever is before written, of\nthe nature of the planets, take notice, that\nfixed stars of the same nature, work the\nsame effect.\nIn fortifying this, (which ought to be\ndone in all purgations,) let the Moon be in\nCancer, Scorpio, or Pisces, or let one of these\nsigns ascend.\nAlthough I did what I could throughout\nthe whole book to express myself in such a\nlanguage as might be understood by all, and\ntherefore avoided terms of art as much as\nmight be, Yet, 1. Some words of necessity fall\nin which need explanation. 2. It would be\nvery tedious at the end of every receipt to repeat\nover and over again, the way of administration\nof the receipt, or ordering your bodies after it,\nor to instruct you in the mixture of medicines,\nand indeed would do nothing else but stuff the\nbook full of tautology.\nTo answer to both these is my task at this\ntime.\nTo the first: The words which need explaining,\nsuch as are obvious to my eye, are\nthese that follow.\n1. To distil in Balneo Mariæ, is the usual\nway of distilling in water. It is no more than\nto place your glass body which holds the matter\nto be distilled in a convenient vessel of water,\nwhen the water is cold (for fear of breaking)\nput a wisp of straw, or the like under it, to keep\nit from the bottom, then make the water boil,\nthat so the spirit may be distilled forth; take\nnot the glass out till the water be cold again,\nfor fear of breaking: It is impossible for a\nman to learn how to do it, unless he saw it\ndone.\n2. Manica Hippocrates, Hippocrates’s\nsleeve, is a piece of woolen cloth, new and\nwhite, sewed together in form of a sugar-loaf.\nIts use is, to strain any syrup or decoction\nthrough, by pouring it into it, and suffering\nit to run through without pressing or crushing\nit.\n3. Calcination, is a burning of a thing in\na crucible or other such convenient vessel\nthat will endure the fire. A crucible is such\na thing as goldsmiths melt silver in, and\nfounders metals; you may place it in the\nmidst of the fire, with coals above, below,\nand on every side of it.\n4. Filtrition, is straining of a liquid body\nthrough a brown paper: make up the paper\nin form of a funnel, the which having placed[216]\nin a funnel, and the funnel and the paper\nin it in an empty glass, pour in the liquor\nyou would filter, and let it run through at its\nleisure.\n5. Coagulation, is curdling or hardening:\nit is used in physic for reducing a liquid\nbody to hardness by the heat of the fire.\n6. Whereas you find vital, natural, and\nanimal spirits often mentioned in the virtues\nor receipts, I shall explain what they be,\nand what their operation is in the body of\nman.\nThe actions or operations of the animal\nvirtues, are, 1. sensitive, 2. motive.\nThe sensitive is, 1. external, 2. internal.\nThe external senses are, 1. seeing, 2. hearing,\n3. tasting, 4. smelling, 5. feeling.\nThe internal senses are, 1. the Imagination,\nto apprehend a thing. 2. Judgment, to judge\nof it. 3. Memory, to remember it.\nThe seat of all these is in the brain.\nThe vital spirits proceed from the heart,\nand cause in man mirth, joy, hope, trust,\nhumanity, mildness, courage, &c. and their\nopposite: viz. sadness, fear, care, sorrow,\ndespair, envy, hatred, stubbornness, revenge, &c.\nby heat natural or not natural.\nThe natural spirit nourishes the body\nthroughout (as the vital quickens it, and the\nanimal gives it sense and motion) its office\nis to alter or concoct food into chile, chile\ninto blood, blood into flesh, to form, engender,\nnourish, and increase the body.\n7. Infusion, is to steep a gross body into\none more liquid.\n8. Decoction, is the liquor in which any\nthing is boiled.\nAs for the manner of using or ordering\nthe body after any sweating, or purging\nmedicines, or pills, or the like, they will be\nfound in different parts of the work, as also\nin the next page.\nThe different forms of making up medicines,\nas some into syrups, others into electuaries,\npills, troches, &c. was partly to\nplease the different palates of people, that\nso medicines might be more delightful, or at\nleast less burdensome. You may make the\nmixtures of them in what form you please,\nonly for your better instruction at present,\naccept of these few lines.\n1. Consider, that all diseases are cured by\ntheir contraries, but all parts of the body\nmaintained by their likes: then if heat be\nthe cause of the disease, give the cold medicine\nappropriated to it; if wind, see how\nmany medicines appropriated to that disease\nexpel wind, and use them.\n2. Have a care you use not such medicines\nto one part of your body which are\nappropriated to another, for if your brain\nbe over heated, and you use such medicines\nas cool the heart or liver, you may make\nbad work.\n3. The distilled water of any herb you\nwould take for a disease, is a fit mixture\nfor the syrup of the same herb, or to make\nany electuary into a drink, if you affect\nsuch liquid medicines best; if you have not\nthe distilled water, make use of the decoction.\n4. Diseases that lie in the parts of the\nbody remote from the stomach and bowels,\nit is in vain to think to carry away the cause\nat once, and therefore you had best do it by\ndegrees; pills, and such like medicines which\nare hard in the body, are fittest for such a\nbusiness, because they are longest before\nthey digest.\n5. Use no strong medicines, if weak will\nserve the turn, you had better take one too\nweak by half, than too strong in the least.\n6. Consider the natural temper of the part\nof the body afflicted, and maintain it in that,\nelse you extinguish nature, as the heart is\nhot, the brain cold, or at least the coldest\npart of the body.\n7. Observe this general rule; That such\nmedicines as are hot in the first degree are\nmost habitual to our bodies, because they\nare just of the heat of our blood.\n8. All opening medicines, and such as[217]\nprovoke urine or the menses, or break the\nstone, may most conveniently be given in\nwhite wine, because white wine of itself is\nof an opening nature, and cleanses the\nveins.\n9. Let all such medicines as are taken\nto stop fluxes or looseness, be taken before\nmeat, about an hour before, more or less,\nthat so they may strengthen the digestion\nand retentive faculty, before the food come\ninto the stomach, but such as are subject to\nvomit up their meat, let them take such\nmedicines as stay vomiting presently after\nmeat, at the conclusion of their meals, that\nso they may close up the mouth of the\nstomach; and that is the reason why usually\nmen eat a bit of cheese after meat, because\nby its sourness and binding it closes the\nmouth of the stomach, thereby staying\nbelching and vomiting.\n10. In taking purges be very careful, and\nthat you may be so, observe these rules.\n(1.) Consider what the humour offending\nis, and let the medicine be such as purges\nthat humour, else you will weaken nature,\nnot the disease.\n(2.) Take notice, if the humour you would\npurge out be thin, then gentle medicines will\nserve the turn, but if it be tough and viscous,\nthen such medicines as are cutting and\nopening, the night before you would take\nthe purge.\n(3.) In purging tough humours, forbear as\nmuch as may be such medicines as leave a\nbinding quality behind them.\n(4.) Have a care of taking purges when\nyour body is astringent; your best way, is\nfirst to open it by a clyster.\n(5.) In taking opening medicines, you\nmay safely take them at night, eating but\na little supper three or four hours before,\nand the next morning drinking a draught of\nwarm posset-drink, and you need not fear\nto go about your business. In this manner\nyou may take Lenitive Electuary, Diacatholicon,\nPulp of Cassia, and the like gentle\nelectuaries, as also all pills that have neither\nDiagrydium nor Colocynthus, in them. But\nall violent purges require a due ordering of\nthe body; such ought to be taken in the\nmorning after you are up, and not to sleep\nafter them before they are done working, at\nleast before night: two hours after you have\ntaken them, drink a draught of warm posset-drink,\nor broth, and six hours after eat a\nbit of mutton, often walking about the\nchamber; let there be a good fire in the\nchamber, and stir not out of the chamber\ntill the purge have done working, or not till\nnext day.\nLastly, Take sweating medicines when\nyou are in bed, covered warm, and in the\ntime of your sweating drink posset-drink as\nhot as you can. If you sweat for a fever, boil\nsorrel and red sage in your posset-drink,\nsweat an hour or longer if your strength will\npermit, then (the chamber being kept very\nwarm) shift yourself all but your head, about\nwhich (the cap which you sweat in being\nstill kept on) wrap a napkin very hot, to\nrepel the vapours back.\nI confess these, or many of these directions\nmay be found in one place of the\nbook or other, and I delight as little to write\ntautology as another, but considering it\nmight make for the public good, I inserted\nthem in this place: if, notwithstanding, any\nwill be so mad as to do themselves a mischief,\nthe fault is not mine."

    "full_text": "ROOTS.\nAcanths, Brancæ Ursinæ. Of bearsbreech,\nor brankursine, it is meanly hot and dry,\nhelps aches and numness of the joints, and is\nof a binding quality, good for wounds and\nbroken bones. Dioscorides saith, they are\nprofitable for ruptures, or such as are\nbursten, or burnt with fire, a dram of the\nroot in powder being taken in the morning[218]\nfasting, in a decoction made with the same\nroot and water.\nAcori, Veri, Perigrini, vulgaris, &c. See\nCalamus Aromaticus. I shall not speak concerning\nthe several sorts of it, one of which\nis Water-flag, or Flower-de-luce, which is\nhot and dry in the second degree, binds,\nstrengthens, stops fluxes of the belly, and\nimmoderate flowing of the menses, a dram\nbeing taken in red wine every morning.\nAllium. Garlic. It is hot and dry in the\nfourth degree, breeds corrupt blood, yet is\nan enemy to all poisons, and such as are\nbitten by cold venomous beasts, viz. Adders,\nToads, Spiders, &c. it provokes urine, and\nexpels wind.\nAlcannæ. Of privet. See the leaves.\nAlthææ. Of Marsh mallows, are meanly\nhot, of a digesting, softening nature, ease\npains, help bloody fluxes, the stone, and\ngravel; being bruised and boiled in milk,\nand the milk drank, is a good remedy for gripings\nof the belly, and the bloody flux. If\na fever accompany the disease, boil a handful\nof common mallow leaves with a handful\nof these roots.\nAngelicæ. Of Angelica; is hot and dry\nin the third degree, strengthens the heart,\nand is good against pestilence and poison,\nhalf a dram taken in the morning fasting.\nAnchusæ. Of Alkanet; cold and dry,\nbinding, good for old ulcers.\nAnthoræ. A foreign root, the counterpoison\nfor Monkshood, it is an admirable\nremedy for the wind cholic, and resists\npoison.\nApii. Of smallage. See the barks.\nAristolochiæ. Of birthwort; of which are\nthree sorts, long, round, and climing: All\nhot and dry in the third degree. The long,\nbeing drank in wine, brings away both\nbirth and after-birth, and whatsoever a careless\nmidwife hath left behind. Dioscorides,\nGalen. The round, being drank with wine,\nhelps (besides the former) stuffings of the\nlungs, hardness of the spleen, ruptures, convulsions;\nboth of them resist poison. I\nnever read any use of the climing birthwort.\nArtanitæ, Cyclaminis, &c. Or Sowbread;\nhot and dry in the third degree, a most\nviolent purge, dangerous; outwardly applied\nto the place, it profits much in the\nbitings of venomous beasts, also being hung\nabout women in labour, it causes speedy\ndeliverance. See the Herb.\nArundinis, Vallanoriæ, and Saccharinæ.\nOf common reeds and sugar reeds. The\nroots of common reeds applied to the place\ndraw out thorns, and ease sprains; the\nashes of them mixed with vinegar, take\nscurf, or dandrif off from the head, and\nprevent the falling off of the hair, they are\nhot and dry in the second degree, according\nto Galen. I never read any virtue of the\nroot of sugar cane.\nAri, &c. Of Cuckow-points, or Wake-Robin,\nhot and dry in the third degree,\nI know no great good they do inwardly\ntaken, unless to play the rogue withal, or\nmake sport: outwardly applied, they take\noff scurf, morphew, or freckles from the\nface, clear the skin, and ease the pains\nof the gout.\nAsclepiadis, vincetoxici. Of Swallow-wort,\nhot and dry, good against poison, and\ngripings of the belly, as also against the\nbitings of mad dogs, taken inwardly.\nAsari. Of Asarabacca: the roots are\na safer purge than the leaves, and not so\nviolent, they purge by vomit, stool, and\nurine; they are profitable for such as have\nagues, dropsies, stoppings of the liver, or\nspleen, green sickness.\nAsparagi. Of Asparagus, or sperage:\nthey are temperate in quality, opening,\nthey provoke urine, and cleanse the reins\nand bladder, being boiled in white wine,\nand the wine drank.\nAsphodeli, Hastæ Regiæ fœm. Of Kings\nSpear, or Female Asphodel. I know no\nphysical use of the roots; probably there[219]\nis, for I do not believe God created any\nthing of no use.\nAsphodeli, Albuci, muris. Of male Asphodel.\nHot and dry in the second degree,\ninwardly taken, they provoke vomit, urine,\nand the menses: outwardly used in ointments,\nthey cause hair to grow, cleanse\nulcers, and take away morphew and freckles\nfrom the face.\nBardanæ, &c. Of Bur, Clot-bur, or Burdock,\ntemperately hot and dry. Helps\nsuch as spit blood and matter; bruised and\nmixed with salt and applied to the place,\nhelps the bitings of mad dogs. It expels\nwind, eases pains of the teeth, strengthens\nthe back, helps the running of the reins,\nand the whites, being taken inwardly.\nDioscorides, Apuleius.\nBehen. alb. rub. Of Valerian, white and\nred.

Stamped and boiled in wine it\nspeedily helps (being drank) all broken bones,\nand is of incredible virtue that way; as also\nbeing stamped and applied to the place, it\nsoon heals all wounds, and quickly takes away\nthe black and blue marks of blows, being\nbruised and applied to the place, and for\nthese, I am persuaded there is not a better\nmedicine under the sun.\nPorri. Of Leeks. They say they are\nhot and dry in the fourth degree; they\nbreed ill-favoured nourishment at the best,\nthey spoil the eyes, heat the body, cause\ntroublesome sleep, and are noisome to the\nstomach: yet are they good for something\nelse, for the juice of them dropped into\nthe ears takes away the noise of them, mixed\nwith a little vinegar and snuffed up the\nnose, it stays the bleeding of it, they are\nbetter of the two boiled than raw, but\nboth ways exceedingly hurtful for ulcers in\nthe bladder: and so are onions and garlic.\nPrunellorum Silvestrium. Of Sloe-bush,\nor Sloe-tree. I think the college set this\namongst the roots only for fashion sake,\nand I did it because they did.\nPyrethri Salivaris, &c. Pelitory of Spain.\nIt is hot and dry in the fourth degree,\nchewed in the mouth, it draws away rheum\nin the tooth-ache; bruised and boiled in\noil, it provokes sweat by unction; inwardly\ntaken, they say it helps palsies and other\ncold effects in the brain and nerves.\nRhapontici, Rhupontick, or Rhubarb\nof Pontus. It takes away windiness and\nweakness of the stomach, sighings, sobbings,\nspittings of blood, diseases of the liver and\nspleen, rickets, &c. if you take a dram at\na time it will purge a little, but bind much,\nand therefore fit for foul bodies that have\nfluxes.\nRhabarbari. Of Rhubarb. It gently\npurges choler from the stomach and liver,\nopens stoppings, withstands the dropsy,\nHypocondriac Melancholly; a little boiling\ntakes away the virtue of it, and therefore\nit is best given by infusion only; If\nyour body be any thing strong, you may\ntake two drams of it at a time being sliced\nthin and steeped all night in white wine, in\nthe morning strain it out and drink the\nwhite wine; it purges but gently, it leaves\na binding quality behind it, therefore dried\na little by the fire and beaten into powder,\nit is usually given in fluxes.\nRhaphani, Domesticœ and Sylvestris. Of\nRaddishes, garden and wild. Garden\nRaddishes provoke urine, break the stone,\nand purge by urine exceedingly, yet breed\nvery bad blood, are offensive to the stomach,\nand hard of digestion, hot and dry in\nquality. Wild, or Horse Raddishes, such\nas grow in ditches, are hotter and drier\nthan the former, and more effectual.\nRhodie Rad. Rose Root. Stamped and\napplied to the head it mitigates the pains\nthereof, being somewhat cool in quality.\nRhabarbari Monachorum. Monks Rhubarb,\nor Bastard-Rhubarb, it also purges,\nand cleanses the blood, and opens obstructions\nof the liver.\nRubiæ tinctorum. Of Madder. It is\nboth drying and binding, yet not without\nsome opening quality, for it helps the yellow\njaundice, and therefore opens obstructions\nof the liver and gall; it is given with\ngood success, to such as have had bruises\nby falls, stops looseness, the hemorrhoids,\nand the menses.\nRusci. Of Knee-holly or Butchers-broom,\nor Bruscus. They are meanly hot\nand dry, provoke urine, break the stone,\nand help such as cannot evacuate urine\nfreely. Use them like grass roots.\nSambuci.

Of Satyrion, each sort.\nThey are hot and moist in temper, provoke\nvenery, and increase seed; each branch\nbears two roots, both spongy, yet the one\nmore solid than the other, which is of most\nvirtue, and indeed only to be used, for some\nsay the most spongy root is quite contrary\nin operation to the other, as the one increaseth,\nthe other decreaseth.\nSaxifragiæ albæ. Of white Saxifrage, in\nSussex we call them Lady-smocks. The\nroots powerfully break the stone, expel\nwind, provoke urine, and cleanse the reins.\nSanguisorbæ. A kind of Burnet.\nScabiosa. Of Scabious. The roots either\nboiled, or beaten into powder, and so taken,\nhelp such as are extremely troubled with\nscabs and itch, are medicinal in the french\ndisease, hard swellings, inward wounds,\nbeing of a drying, cleansing, and healing\nfaculty.\nScordij. Of Scordium, or Water-Germander.\nSee the herb.\nScillæ. Of Squills. See vinegar, and\nwine of Squills, in the compound.\nScropulariæ, &c. Of Figwort. The roots\nbeing of the same virtue with the herb,\nI refer you thither.\nScorzoneræ. Of Vipers grass. The root\ncheers the heart, and strengthens the vital\nspirits, resists poison, helps passions and\ntremblings of the heart, faintness, sadness,\nand melancholy, opens stoppings of the\nliver and spleen, provokes the menses, ease\nwomen of the fits of the mother, and helps\nswimmings in the head.\nSeseleos. Of Seseli, or Hartwort. The\nroots provoke urine, and help the falling-sickness.\nSisari, secacul. Of Scirrets. They are\nhot and moist, of good nourishment, something\nwindy, as all roots are; by reason of\nwhich, they provoke venery, they stir up\nappetite, and provoke urine.\nSconchi. Of Sow-thistles. See the herb.\nSpinæ albæ, Bedeguar. The Arabians\ncalled our Ladies-thistles by that name;\nthe roots of which are drying and binding,\nstop fluxes, bleeding, take away\ncold swellings, and ease the pains of the\nteeth.\nSpatulæ fœtidæ. Stinking Gladon, a kind\nof Flower-de-luce, called so for its unsavory\nsmell. It is hot and dry in the third\ndegree; outwardly they help the king’s evil,\nsoften hard swellings, draw out broken\nbones: inwardly taken, they help convulsions,\nruptures, bruises, infirmities of the\nlungs.\nTamarisci. Of Tamaris. See the herbs,\nand barks.\nTanaceti. Of Tansie. The root eaten,\nis a singular remedy for the gout: the rich\nmay bestow the cost to preserve it.\nThapsi, &c.

They help diseases and ulcers in\nthe throat.\nTrinitatis herbæ. Hearts-ease, or Pansies.\nI know no great virtue they have.\nTunicis. I shall tell you the virtue when\nI know what it is.\nTripolij. The root purges flegm, expels\npoison.\nTurbith. The root purges flegm, (being\nhot in the third degree) chiefly from the\nexterior parts of the body: it is corrected\nwith ginger, or Mastich. Let not the vulgar\nbe too busy with it.\nTuburnum. Or Toad-stools. Whether\nthese be roots or no, it matters not much[227]:\nfor my part I know but little need of them,\neither in food or physic.\nVictorialis. A foreign kind of Garlick.\nThey say, being hung about the neck of\ncattle that are blind suddenly, it helps them;\nand defends those that bear it, from evil\nspirits.\nSwallow-wort, and teazles were handled\nbefore.\nUlmariæ, Reginæ, prati, &c.

This\nand Zurumbet, according to Rhasis, and\nMesue, are all one; Avicenna thinks them\ndifferent: I hold with Mesue; indeed they\ndiffer in form, for the one is long, the other\nround; they are both hot and dry in the\nsecond degree, expel wind, resist poison,\nstop fluxes, and the menses, stay vomiting,\nhelp the cholic, and kill worms; you may\ntake half a dram at a time.\nZingiberis. Of Ginger. Helps digestion,\nwarms the stomach, clears the sight, and is\nprofitable for old men: heats the joints, and\ntherefore is profitable against the gout,\nexpels wind; it is hot and dry in the second\ndegree."

Of the roots of Smallage.\nTake notice here, that the Barks both of\nthis root, as also of Parsley, Fennel, &c.\nis all of the root which is in use, neither\ncan it properly be called bark, for it is all\nthe root, the hard pith in the middle excepted,\nwhich is always thrown away, when\nthe roots are used. It is something hotter\nand drier than Parsley, and more medicinal;\nit opens stoppings, provokes urine, helps\ndigestion, expels wind, and warms a cold\nstomach: use them like grass roots.\nAvellanarum. Of Hazel. The rind of\nthe tree provokes urine, breaks the stone;\nthe husks and shells of the nuts, dried and\ngiven in powder, stay the immoderate flux\nof the menses.\nAurantiorum. Of Oranges. Both these,\nand also Lemons and Citrons, are of different\nqualities: the outward bark, viz. what\nlooks red, is hot and dry, the white is cold\nand moist, the juice colder than it, the seeds\nhot and dry; the outward bark is that\nwhich here I am to speak to, it is somewhat\nhotter than either that of Lemons or\nCitrons, therefore it warms a cold stomach\nmore, and expels wind better, but strengthens\nnot the heart so much.\nBerber, &c. Barberries. The Rind of\nthe tree according to Clœsius, being steeped\nin wine, and the wine drank, purges choler,\nand is a singular remedy for the yellow\njaundice. Boil it in white wine and drink\nit. See the directions at the beginning.\nCassia Lignea, &c.

There\nis scarce a better remedy for women in\nlabour, than a dram of Cinnamon newly\nbeaten into powder, and taken in white\nwine.\nCitrij. Of Pome Citrons.

Of green Walnuts.\nAs for the outward green bark of Walnuts,\nI suppose the best time to take them is\nbefore the Walnuts be shelled at all, and\nthen you may take nuts and all (if they may\nproperly be called nuts at such a time) you\nshall find them exceeding comfortable to\nthe stomach, they resist poison, and are\na most excellent preservative against the\nplague, inferior to none: they are admirable\nfor such as are troubled with consumptions\nof the lungs.\nLauri. Of the Bay-tree. See the root.\nLimonum. Of Lemons. The outward\npeel is of the nature of Citron, but helps\nnot so effectually; however, let the poor\ncountry man that cannot get the other, use\nthis.\nMandragora Rad.

Neither\nany comparable to the stinging of bees and\nwasps, &c. than the same that sting you,\nbruised and applied to the place.\nLand Scorpions cure their own stingings by\nthe same means; the ashes of them (being\nburnt) potently provokes urine, and breaks the\nstone.\nEarth-worms, are an admirable remedy for\ncut nerves being applied to the place; they provoke\nurine; see the oil of them, only let me not\nforget one notable thing quoted by Mizaldus,\nwhich is, That the powder of them put into an\nhollow tooth, makes it drop out.\nTo draw a tooth without pain, fill an earthen\ncrucible full of Emmets, Ants, or Pismires,\neggs and all, and when you have burned them,\nkeep the ashes, with which if you touch a tooth\nit will fall out.\nEels, being put into wine or beer, and suffered\nto die in it, he that drinks it will never endure\nthat sort of liquor again.\nOysters applied alive to a pestilential swelling,\ndraw the venom to them.\nCrab-fish, burnt to ashes, and a dram of it\ntaken every morning helps the bitings of mad\ndogs, and all other venomous beasts.\nSwallows, being eaten, clear the sight, the\nashes of them (being burnt) eaten, preserve[253]\nfrom drunkenness, helps sore throats being applied\nto them, and inflammations.\nGrass-hoppers, being eaten, ease the cholic,\nand pains in the bladder.\nHedge Sparrows, being kept in salt, or dried\nand eaten raw, are an admirable remedy for\nthe stone.\nYoung Pigeons being eaten, help pains in\nthe reins, and the disease called Tenesmus.\nPARTS OF LIVING CREATURES, AND EXCREMENTS.\nThe brain of Sparrows being eaten, provokes\nlust exceedingly.\nThe brain of an Hare being roasted, helps\ntrembling, it makes children breed teeth\neasily, their gums being rubbed with it, it\nalso helps scald heads, and falling off of\nhair, the head being anointed with it.\nThe head of a young Kite, being burnt\nto ashes and the quantity of a drachm of it\ntaken every morning in a little water, is an\nadmirable remedy against the gout.\nCrab-eyes break the stone, and open\nstoppings of the bowels.\nThe lungs of a Fox, well dried, (but not\nburned) is an admirable strengthener to\nthe lungs: see the Lohoch of Fox lungs.\nThe liver of a Duck, stops fluxes, and\nstrengthens the liver exceedingly.\nThe liver of a Frog, being dried and\neaten, helps quartan agues, or as the vulgar\ncall them, third-day agues.\nCastoreum resists poison, the bitings of\nvenomous beasts; it provokes the menses,\nand brings forth birth and after-birth; it\nexpels wind, eases pains and aches, convulsions,\nsighings, lethargies; the smell of\nit allays the fits of the mother; inwardly\ngiven, it helps tremblings, falling-sickness,\nand other such ill effects of the brain and\nnerves: A scruple is enough to take at a\ntime, and indeed spirit of Castorium is better\nthan Castorium, raw, to which I refer\nyou.\nA Sheep’s or Goat’s bladder being burnt,\nand the ashes given inwardly, helps the\nDiabetes.\nA flayed Mouse dried and beaten into\npowder, and given at a time, helps such as\ncannot hold their water, or have a Diabetes,\nif you do the like three days together.\nIvory, or Elephant’s tooth, binds, stops\nthe Whites, it strengthens the heart and\nstomach, helps the yellow jaundice, and\nmakes women fruitful.\nThose small bones which are found in\nthe fore-feet of an Hare, being beaten into\npowder and drank in wine, powerfully provoke\nurine.\nGoose grease, and Capons grease, are both\nsoftening, help gnawing sores, stiffness of\nthe womb, and mitigate pain.\nI am of opinion that the suet of a Goat\nmixed with a little saffron, is as excellent\nan ointment for the gout, especially the\ngout in the knees, as any is.\nBears grease stays the falling off of the\nhair.\nFox grease helps pains in the ears.\nElk’s Claws or hoofs are a sovereign remedy\nfor the falling sickness, though it be but\nworn in a ring, much more being taken inwardly;\nbut saith Mizaldus, it must be the\nhoof of the right foot behind.\nMilk is an extreme windy meat; therefore\nI am of the opinion of Dioscorides, viz.\nthat it is not profitable in head-aches; yet\nthis is for certain, that it is an admirable\nremedy for inward ulcers in any part of\nthe body, or any corrosions, or excoriations,\npains in the reins and bladder: but it is\nvery bad in diseases of the liver, spleen, the\nfalling-sickness, vertigo, or dissiness in the\nhead, fevers and head-aches; Goat’s milk\nis held to be better than Cow’s for Hectic\nfevers, phthisick, and consumptions, and\nso is Ass’s also.\nWhey, attenuates and cleanses both choler[254]\nand melancholy: wonderfully helps\nmelancholy and madness coming of it;\nopens stoppings of the bowels; helps such\nas have the dropsy and are troubled with\nthe stoppings of the spleen, rickets and\nhypochondriac melancholy: for such diseases\nyou may make up your physic with\nwhey.

Neither\nany comparable to the stinging of bees and\nwasps, &c. than the same that sting you,\nbruised and applied to the place.\nLand Scorpions cure their own stingings by\nthe same means; the ashes of them (being\nburnt) potently provokes urine, and breaks the\nstone.\nEarth-worms, are an admirable remedy for\ncut nerves being applied to the place; they provoke\nurine; see the oil of them, only let me not\nforget one notable thing quoted by Mizaldus,\nwhich is, That the powder of them put into an\nhollow tooth, makes it drop out.\nTo draw a tooth without pain, fill an earthen\ncrucible full of Emmets, Ants, or Pismires,\neggs and all, and when you have burned them,\nkeep the ashes, with which if you touch a tooth\nit will fall out.\nEels, being put into wine or beer, and suffered\nto die in it, he that drinks it will never endure\nthat sort of liquor again.\nOysters applied alive to a pestilential swelling,\ndraw the venom to them.\nCrab-fish, burnt to ashes, and a dram of it\ntaken every morning helps the bitings of mad\ndogs, and all other venomous beasts.\nSwallows, being eaten, clear the sight, the\nashes of them (being burnt) eaten, preserve[253]\nfrom drunkenness, helps sore throats being applied\nto them, and inflammations.\nGrass-hoppers, being eaten, ease the cholic,\nand pains in the bladder.\nHedge Sparrows, being kept in salt, or dried\nand eaten raw, are an admirable remedy for\nthe stone.\nYoung Pigeons being eaten, help pains in\nthe reins, and the disease called Tenesmus.\nPARTS OF LIVING CREATURES, AND EXCREMENTS.\nThe brain of Sparrows being eaten, provokes\nlust exceedingly.\nThe brain of an Hare being roasted, helps\ntrembling, it makes children breed teeth\neasily, their gums being rubbed with it, it\nalso helps scald heads, and falling off of\nhair, the head being anointed with it.\nThe head of a young Kite, being burnt\nto ashes and the quantity of a drachm of it\ntaken every morning in a little water, is an\nadmirable remedy against the gout.\nCrab-eyes break the stone, and open\nstoppings of the bowels.\nThe lungs of a Fox, well dried, (but not\nburned) is an admirable strengthener to\nthe lungs: see the Lohoch of Fox lungs.\nThe liver of a Duck, stops fluxes, and\nstrengthens the liver exceedingly.\nThe liver of a Frog, being dried and\neaten, helps quartan agues, or as the vulgar\ncall them, third-day agues.\nCastoreum resists poison, the bitings of\nvenomous beasts; it provokes the menses,\nand brings forth birth and after-birth; it\nexpels wind, eases pains and aches, convulsions,\nsighings, lethargies; the smell of\nit allays the fits of the mother; inwardly\ngiven, it helps tremblings, falling-sickness,\nand other such ill effects of the brain and\nnerves: A scruple is enough to take at a\ntime, and indeed spirit of Castorium is better\nthan Castorium, raw, to which I refer\nyou.\nA Sheep’s or Goat’s bladder being burnt,\nand the ashes given inwardly, helps the\nDiabetes.\nA flayed Mouse dried and beaten into\npowder, and given at a time, helps such as\ncannot hold their water, or have a Diabetes,\nif you do the like three days together.\nIvory, or Elephant’s tooth, binds, stops\nthe Whites, it strengthens the heart and\nstomach, helps the yellow jaundice, and\nmakes women fruitful.\nThose small bones which are found in\nthe fore-feet of an Hare, being beaten into\npowder and drank in wine, powerfully provoke\nurine.\nGoose grease, and Capons grease, are both\nsoftening, help gnawing sores, stiffness of\nthe womb, and mitigate pain.\nI am of opinion that the suet of a Goat\nmixed with a little saffron, is as excellent\nan ointment for the gout, especially the\ngout in the knees, as any is.\nBears grease stays the falling off of the\nhair.\nFox grease helps pains in the ears.\nElk’s Claws or hoofs are a sovereign remedy\nfor the falling sickness, though it be but\nworn in a ring, much more being taken inwardly;\nbut saith Mizaldus, it must be the\nhoof of the right foot behind.\nMilk is an extreme windy meat; therefore\nI am of the opinion of Dioscorides, viz.\nthat it is not profitable in head-aches; yet\nthis is for certain, that it is an admirable\nremedy for inward ulcers in any part of\nthe body, or any corrosions, or excoriations,\npains in the reins and bladder: but it is\nvery bad in diseases of the liver, spleen, the\nfalling-sickness, vertigo, or dissiness in the\nhead, fevers and head-aches; Goat’s milk\nis held to be better than Cow’s for Hectic\nfevers, phthisick, and consumptions, and\nso is Ass’s also.\nWhey, attenuates and cleanses both choler[254]\nand melancholy: wonderfully helps\nmelancholy and madness coming of it;\nopens stoppings of the bowels; helps such\nas have the dropsy and are troubled with\nthe stoppings of the spleen, rickets and\nhypochondriac melancholy: for such diseases\nyou may make up your physic with\nwhey. Outwardly it cleanses the skin of\nsuch deformities as come through choler or\nmelancholy, as scabs, itch, morphew, leprosies,\n&c.\nHoney is of a gallant cleansing quality,\nexceeding profitable in all inward ulcers in\nwhat part of the body soever; it opens the\nveins, cleanses the reins and bladder. I\nknow no vices belonging to it, but only it\nis soon converted into choler.\nWax, softens, heats, and meanly fills\nsores with flesh, it suffers not the milk to\ncurdle in women’s breasts; inwardly it is\ngiven (ten grains at a time) against bloody-fluxes.\nRaw-silk, heats and dries, cheers the\nheart, drives away sadness, comforts all the\nspirits, both natural, vital and animal."

Venice and\nCyprus Turpentine. Sugar, white, red, and\nChristaline, or Sugar Candy white and red,\nSagapen, Juniper, Gum, Sanguis Draconis,\nSarcocolla, Scamony, Styrax, Liquid and\nCalamitis, Tacha, Mahacca, Tartar, Frankincense,\nOlibanum, Tragaganth, Birdlime.\nCulpeper.] That my country may receive\nmore benefit than ever the college of Physicians\nintended them from these, I shall\ntreat of them severally.\n1. Of the Juices.\n2. Of the Gums and Rosins.\nConcrete Juices, or Juices made thick, are either\nTemperate, as, Juice of Liquorice, white\nstarch.\nHot in the first degree. Sugar.\nIn the second. Labdanum.\nIn the third. Benzoin, Assafœtida.\nCold in the third degree. Sanguis Draconis,\nAcacia.\nIn the third. Hypocistis.\nIn the fourth. Opium, and yet some\nauthors think Opium is hot because of its\nbitter taste.\nAloes and Manna purge choler gently;\nand Scamony doth purge choler violently,\nthat it is no ways fit for a vulgar man’s use,\nfor it corrodes the Bowels. Opopoanax\npurges flegm very gently.\nWhite starch gently levigates or makes\nsmooth such parts as are rough, syrup of\nViolets being made thick with it and so\ntaken on the point of a knife, helps coughs,\nroughness of the throat, wheezing, excoriations\nof the bowels, the bloody-flux.\nJuice of Liquorice helps roughness of the\nTrachea Arteria, which is in plain English\ncalled the windpipe, the roughness of which\ncauses coughs and hoarseness, difficulty of\nbreathing, &c. It allays the heat of the\nstomach and liver, eases pains, soreness and\nroughness of the reins and bladder, it\nquencheth thirst, and strengthens the\nstomach exceedingly: It may easily be\ncarried about in one’s pocket, and eat a little\nnow and then.\nSugar cleanses and digests, takes away\nroughness of the tongue, it strengthens the\nreins and bladder, being weakened: being\nbeaten into fine powder and put into the\neyes, it takes away films that grow over\nthe sight.\nLabdanum is in operation, thickening,\nheating and mollifying, it opens the passage\nof the veins, and keeps the hair from falling\noff; the use of it is usually external: being\nmixed with wine, myrrh, and oil of mirtles,[271]\nand applied like a plaister, it takes away\nfilthy scars, and the deformity the small\npox leaves behind them; being mixed with\noil of Roses, and dropped into the ears, it\nhelps pains there; being used as a pessary,\nit provokes the menses, and helps\nhardness or stiffness of the womb. It is\nsometimes used inwardly in such medicines\nas ease pains and help the cough: if you\nmix a little of it with old white wine and\ndrink it, it both provokes urine and stops\nlooseness or fluxes.\nDragons blood, cools, binds, and repels.\nAcasia, and Hyposistis, do the like.\nThe juice of Maudlin, or, for want of it\nCostmary, which is the same in effect, and\nbetter known to the vulgar, the juice is made\nthick for the better keeping of it; first\nclarify the juice before you boil it to its due\nthickness, which is something thicker than\nhoney.\nIt is appropriated to the liver, and the\nquantity of a dram taken every morning,\nhelps the Cachexia, or evil disposition of\nthe body proceeding from coldness of the\nliver: it helps the rickets and worms in\nchildren, provokes urine, and gently (without\npurging) disburdens the body of choler\nand flegm; it succours the lungs, opens obstructions,\nand resists putrifaction of blood.\nGums are either temperate, as, Lacca,\nElemi, Tragacanth, &c.\nIntemperate, and so are hot in the first\ndegree, as Bdellium, Gum of Ivy.\nIn the second, Galbanum, Myrrh, Mastich,\nFrankincense, Olibanum, Pitch, Rozin,\nStyrax.\nIn the third. Amoniacum.\nIn the fourth. Euphorbium.\nGum Arabick is cold.\nColophonia and Styrax soften.\nGum Arabick and Tragacanth, Sandarack\nor Juniper Gum, and Sarcocolla\nbind.\nGum of Cherry trees, breaks the stone.\nStyrax provokes the menses.\nOpopanax gently purges flegm.\nFrom the prickly Cedar when it is burned\ncomes forth that which, with us, is usually\nknown by the name of Tar, and is excellently\ngood for unction either for scabs, itch, or\nmanginess, either in men or beasts, as also\nagainst the leprosy, tetters, ringworms, and\nscald heads.\nAll sorts of Rozins fill up hollow ulcers,\nand relieve the body sore pressed with cold\ngriefs.\nThe Rozin of Pitch-tree, is that which\nis commonly called Burgundy pitch, and\nis something hotter and sharper than the\nformer, being spread upon a cloth is excellently\ngood for old aches coming of former\nbruises or dislocations.\nPitch mollifies hard swellings, and brings\nboils and sores to suppuration, it breaks\ncarbuncles, disperses aposthumes, cleanses\nulcers of corruption and fills them with\nflesh.\nBdellium heats and mollifies, and that very\ntemperately, being mixed with any convenient\nointment or plaister, it helps kernels\nin the neck and throat, Scrophula, or\nthat disease which was called the King’s\nEvil. Inwardly taken in any convenient\nmedicine, it provokes the menses, and breaks\nthe stone, it helps coughs and bitings of\nvenomous beasts: it helps windiness of the\nspleen, and pains in the sides thence coming.\nBoth outwardly applied to the place and\ninwardly taken, it helps ruptures or such as\nare burst, it softens the hardness of the\nwomb, dries up the moisture thereof and\nexpels the dead child.\nBitumen Jadaicum is a certain dry pitch\nwhich the dead sea, or lake of Sodom in India\ncasts forth at certain times, the inhabitants\nthereabouts pitch their ships with it. It is\nof excellent use to mollify the hardness of\nswellings and discuss them, as also against\ninflammations; the smoke of it burnt is\nexcellently good for the fits of the mother,\nand the falling-sickness: Inwardly taken in[272]\nwine it provokes the menses, helps the bitings\nof venomous beasts, and dissolves congealed\nblood in the body.\nAmbergreese is hot and dry in the second\ndegree, I will not dispute whether it be a\nGum or not: It strengthens nature much\nwhich way soever it be taken, there are but\nfew grains usually given of it at a time:\nmixed with a little ointment of Orange\nflowers, and the temples and forehead\nanointed with it, it eases the pains of the\nhead and strengthens the brain exceedingly;\nthe same applied to the privities, helps the\nfits of the mother; inwardly taken it\nstrengthens the brain and memory, the\nheart and vital spirit, warms cold stomachs,\nand is an exceeding strengthener of nature\nto old people, adding vigour to decayed and\nworn-out spirits: it provokes venery, and\nmakes barren women fruitful, if coldness\nand moisture or weakness be the cause impediting.\nAssafœtida being smelled to, is vulgarly\nknown to repress the fits of the mother;\na little bit put into an aching tooth, presently\neases the pain, ten grains of it taken\nbefore dinner, walking half an hour after\nit, provokes appetite, helps digestion,\nstrengthens the stomach, and takes away\nloathing of meat, it provokes lust exceedingly\nand expels wind as much.\nBorax, besides the virtues it has to solder\nGold, Silver, Copper, &c. inwardly given\nin small quantities, it stops fluxes, and the\nrunning of the reins: being in fine powder,\nand put into green wounds, it cures them at\nonce dressing.\nGambuge, which the College calls Gutta\nGamba. I know no good of it.\nCaranna outwardly applied, is excellent\nfor aches and swellings in the nerves and\njoints: If you lay it behind the ears, it\ndraws back humours from the eyes; applied\nto the temples as they usually do Mastich, it\nhelps the tooth-ache.\nGum Elimi, authors appropriate to fractures\nin the skull and head. See Arceus’\nliniment.\nGum Lacca being well purified, and the\nquantity of half a dram taken in any convenient\nliquor, strengthens the stomach and\nliver, opens obstructions, helps the yellow\njaundice and dropsy; provokes urine,\nbreaks the stone in the reins and bladder.\nLiquid Amber is not much unlike liquid\nStyrax: by unction it warms and comforts\na cold and moist brain, it eases all griefs\ncoming of a cold cause, it mightily comforts\nand strengthens a weak stomach, being\nanointed with it, and helps digestion exceedingly,\nit dissolves swellings. It is hot\nin the third degree, and moist in the first.\nI think it would do the commonwealth\nno harm if I should speak a word or two on\nManna here, although it be no Gum: I confess\nauthors make some flutter about it,\nwhat it is, some holding it to be the juice\nof a tree; I am confident it is the very same\ncondensated that our honey-dews here are,\nonly the contries whence it comes being far\nhotter, it falls in great abundance. Let him\nthat desires reason for it, be pleased to read\nButler’s book of Bees, a most excellent\nexperimental work, there he shall find reason\nenough to satisfy any reasonable man.\nChoose the driest and whitest; it is a very\ngentle purger of choler, quenches thirst,\nprovokes appetite, eases the roughness of\nthe throat, helps bitterness in the throat,\nand often proneness to vomit, it is very good\nfor such as are subject to be costive to put\nit into their drink instead of sugar, it hath\nno obnoxious quality at all in it, but may\nbe taken by a pregnant woman without any\ndanger; a child of a year old may take an\nounce of it at a time dissolved in milk, it\nwill melt like sugar, neither will it be known\nfrom it by the taste.\nMyrrh is hot and dry in the second degree,\ndangerous for pregnant women, it is bitter,\nand yet held to be good for the roughness\nof the throat and wind-pipe; half a dram [273]of\nit taken at a time helps rheumatic distillations\nupon the lungs, pains in the sides; it\nstops fluxes, provokes the menses, brings\naway both birth and after-birth, softens the\nhardness of the womb; being taken two\nhours before the fit comes, it helps agues.\nMathiolus saith he seldom used any other\nmedicine for the quartan ague than a dram\nof myrrh given in Muskadel an hour before\nthe fit usually came; if you make it up into\npills with treacle, and take one of them\nevery morning fasting, it is a sovereign\npreservative against the pestilence, against\nthe poison of serpents, and other venomous\nbeasts; a singular remedy for a stinking breath\nif it arise from putrefaction of the stomach,\nit fastens loose teeth, and stays the shedding\noff of the hair, outwardly used it breeds\nflesh in deep wounds, and covers the naked\nbones with flesh.\nOlibanum is hot in the second degree, and\ndry in the first, you may take a dram of it\nat a time, it stops looseness and the running\nof the reins; it strengthens the memory\nexceedingly, comforts the heart, expels sadness\nand melancholy, strengthens the heart,\nhelps coughs, rheums and pleurises; your\nbest way (in my opinion,) to take it is to mix\nit with conserve of roses, and take it in the\nmorning fasting.\nTachamacha is seldom taken inwardly,\noutwardly spread upon leather, and applied\nto the navel; it stays the fits of the mother,\napplied to the side, it mitigates speedily,\nand in little time quite takes away the pain\nand windiness of the spleen; the truth is,\nwhatsoever ache or swelling proceeds of\nwind or cold raw humours, I know no\nbetter plaister coming from beyond sea than\nthis gum. It strengthens the brain and\nmemory exceedingly, and stops all such\ndefluctions thence as trouble the eyes, ears,\nor teeth, it helps the gout and sciatica.\nGum Coopal, and Gum Anime, are very\nlike one another both in body and operation,\nthe former is hard to come by, the last\nnot very easy. It stops defluctions from\nthe head, if you perfume your cap with the\nsmoke of it, it helps the headache and\nmegrim, strengthens the brain, and therefore\nthe sinews.\nGum Tragaganth, which the vulgar call\nGum Dragon, being mixed with pectoral\nSyrups, (which you shall find noted in their\nproper places) it helps coughs and hoarseness,\nsalt and sharp distillations upon the\nlungs, being taken with a liquorice stick,\nbeing dissolved in sweet wine, it helps\n(being drank) gnawing in the bowels, sharpness\nand freetings of the urine, which causes\nexcoriations either in the reins or bladder,\nbeing dissolved in milk and the eyes washed\nwith it, it takes away weals and scabs that\ngrow on the eyelids, it is excellently good to\nbe put in poultice to fodder wounds,\nespecially if the nerves or sinews be hurt.\nSagapen, dissolved in juice of rue and\ntaken, wonderfully breaks the stone in the\nbladder, expels the dead child and afterbirth,\nclears the sight; dissolved in wine\nand drank, it helps the cough, and distillation\nupon the lungs, and the fits of the\nmother; outwardly in oils or ointments, it\nhelps such members as are out of joint or\nover-stretched.\nGalbanum is of the same operation, and\nalso taken from the same plant, viz. Fennel,\nGiant.\nGum Arabic, thickens and cools, and corrects\ncholeric sharp humours in the body,\nbeing dissolved in the white of an egg, well\nbeaten, it helps burnings, and keeps the\nplace from blistering.\nMastich stays fluxes, being taken inwardly\nany way. Three or four small grains of\nMastich, swallowed at night going to bed,\nis a remedy for pains in the stomach,\nbeing beaten into powder, and mixed with\nconserve of Roses, it strengthens the stomach,\nstops distillations upon the lungs, stay,\nvomiting, and causes a sweet breath; being\nmixed with white wine and the mouth[274]\nwashed with it, it cleanses the gums of corruption,\nand fastens loose teeth.\nFrankincense being used outwardly in the\nway of a plaister, heats and binds; being\napplied to the temples, stops the rheums\nthat flow to the eyes, helps green wounds,\nand fills hollow ulcers with flesh, stops the\nbleeding of wounds, though the arteries be\ncut; being made into an ointment with\nVinegar and Hog’s-grease, helps the itch,\npains in the ears, inflammations in women’s\nbreasts commonly called agues in the breast;\nbeware of taking it inwardly, lest it cause\nmadness.\nTurpentine is hot in the second degree, it\nheals, softens, it discusses and purges,\ncleanses the reins, provokes urine.\nStyrax Calamitis is hot and dry in the\nsecond degree, it heals, mollifies, and concocts;\nbeing taken inwardly helps the cough,\nand distillations of the lungs, hoarseness and\nloss of voice, helps the hardness of the\nwomb, and provokes the menses.\nAmmoniacum, hot and dry in the third\ndegree, softens, draws, and heats; being dissolved\nin vinegar, strained and applied\nplaister-wise, it takes away carbuncles and\nhardness in the flesh, it is one of the best\nremedies that I know for infirmities of the\nspleen, being applied to the left side; being\nmade into an ointment with oil, it is good\nto anoint the limbs of such as are weary:\na scruple of it being taken in the form of a\npill loosens the belly, gives speedy delivery\nto women in travail, helps diseases of the\nspleen, the sciatica and all pains in the\njoints, and have any humour afflicting their\nbreast.\nCamphire, it is held by all authority to be\ncold and dry in the third degree, it is of very\nthin subtile parts, insomuch that being\nbeaten into very fine powder it will vanquish\naway into the air, being beaten into powder\nand mixed with oil, and the temples anointed\ntherewith, eases headaches proceeding of\nheat, all inflammations whatsoever, the back\nbeing anointed with the same, cools the reins,\nand seminal vessels, stops the running of\nthe reins and Fluor Albus, the moderate use\nof Venery, the like it doth if it be drank\ninwardly with Bettony-water, take but a\nsmall quantity of it at a time inwardly, it\nresist poison and bitings by venomous\nbeasts; outwardly, applied as before, and\nthe eyes anointed with it, stops hot rheums\nthat flow thither.\nOpopanax purges thick flegm from the\nmost remote parts of the body, viz. the\nbrain, joints, hands, and feet, the nerves\nand breast, and strengthens all those parts\nwhen they are weak, if the weakness proceed\nof cold, as usually it doth; it helps\nweakness of the sight, old rotten coughs,\nand gouts of all sorts, dropsies, and swellings\nof the spleen, it helps the stranguary\nand difficulty of making urine, provokes\nthe menses, and helps all cold afflictions of\nthe womb; have a care you give it not to\nany pregnant women. The dose is one\ndram at most, corrected with a little Mastich,\ndissolved in Vinegar and outwardly applied\nhelps the passions of the spleen.\nIn the next place the College tells you a tale\nconcerning Liquid, Juices, and Tears,\nwhich are to be kept for present use, viz.\nCollege.] Vinegar, Juice of Citrons, Juice\nof sour Grapes, Oranges, Barberries, Tears of\na Birch-tree, Juice of Cherries, Quinces, Pomegranates,\nLemons, Wood-sorrel, Oil of unripe\nOlives, and ripe Olives, both new and old, Juice\nof red and Damask Roses, Wine Tears of a\nVine.\nCulpeper.] The virtues of the most of\nthese may be found in the Syrups, and are\nfew of them used alone.\n[275]\nThen the College tells you there are things\nbred of PLANTS.\nCollege.] Agarick, Jew’s-ears, the berries\nof Chermes, the Spungy substance of the\nBriar, Moss, Viscus Quercinus, Oak, Apples.\nCulpeper.] As the College would have\nyou know this, so would I know what the\nchief of them are good for.\nJew’s-ears boiled in milk and drank,\nhelps sore throats.\nMoss is cold, dry, and binding, therefore\ngood for fluxes of all sorts.\nMisleto of the Oak, it helps the falling\nsickness and the convulsions; being discreetly\ngathered and used.\nOak Apples are dry and binding; being\nboiled in milk and drank, they stop fluxes\nand the menses, and being boiled in vinegar,\nand the body anointed with the vinegar,\ncures the itch.\nThen the College acquaints you, That there\nare certain living Creatures called\nCollege.] Bees, Woodlice, Silkworms,\nToads, Crabs of the River, little Puppy Dogs,\nGrass-hoppers, Cantharides, Cothanel, Hedge-hogs,\nEmmets or Ants, Larks, Swallows, and\ntheir young ones, Horse-leeches, Snails, Earthworms,\nDishwashers or Wagtails, House\nSparrows and Hedge Sparrows, Frogs, Scineus,\nLand Scorpions, Moles, or Monts, Tortoise of\nthe Woods, Tenches, Vipers and Foxes.\nCulpeper.] That part of this crew of\nCattle and some others which they have not\nbeen pleased to learn, may be made beneficial\nto your sick bodies, be pleased to\nunderstand, that\nBees being burnt to ashes, and a lye made\nwith the ashes, trimly decks a bald head\nbeing washed with it.\nSnails with shells on their backs, being\nfirst washed from the dirt, then the shells\nbroken, and they boiled in spring water,\nbut not scummed at all, for the scum will\nsink of itself, and the water drank for\nordinary drink is a most admirable remedy\nfor consumption; being bruised and applied\nto the place they help the gout, draw\nthorns out of the flesh, and held to the nose\nhelp the bleeding thereof.\nTherefore consider that the College gave\nthe Apothecaries a catalogue of what\nParts of Living creatures and Excrements\nthey must keep in their shops.\nCollege.] The fat, grease, or suet, of a\nDuck, Goose, Eel, Boar, Herron, Thymallows,\n(if you know where to get it) Dog,\nCapon, Beaver, wild Cat, Stork, Coney, Horse,\nHedge-hog, Hen, Man, Lion, Hare, Pike,

Of the Juices.\n2. Of the Gums and Rosins.\nConcrete Juices, or Juices made thick, are either\nTemperate, as, Juice of Liquorice, white\nstarch.\nHot in the first degree. Sugar.\nIn the second. Labdanum.\nIn the third. Benzoin, Assafœtida.\nCold in the third degree. Sanguis Draconis,\nAcacia.\nIn the third. Hypocistis.\nIn the fourth. Opium, and yet some\nauthors think Opium is hot because of its\nbitter taste.\nAloes and Manna purge choler gently;\nand Scamony doth purge choler violently,\nthat it is no ways fit for a vulgar man’s use,\nfor it corrodes the Bowels. Opopoanax\npurges flegm very gently.\nWhite starch gently levigates or makes\nsmooth such parts as are rough, syrup of\nViolets being made thick with it and so\ntaken on the point of a knife, helps coughs,\nroughness of the throat, wheezing, excoriations\nof the bowels, the bloody-flux.\nJuice of Liquorice helps roughness of the\nTrachea Arteria, which is in plain English\ncalled the windpipe, the roughness of which\ncauses coughs and hoarseness, difficulty of\nbreathing, &c. It allays the heat of the\nstomach and liver, eases pains, soreness and\nroughness of the reins and bladder, it\nquencheth thirst, and strengthens the\nstomach exceedingly: It may easily be\ncarried about in one’s pocket, and eat a little\nnow and then.\nSugar cleanses and digests, takes away\nroughness of the tongue, it strengthens the\nreins and bladder, being weakened: being\nbeaten into fine powder and put into the\neyes, it takes away films that grow over\nthe sight.\nLabdanum is in operation, thickening,\nheating and mollifying, it opens the passage\nof the veins, and keeps the hair from falling\noff; the use of it is usually external: being\nmixed with wine, myrrh, and oil of mirtles,[271]\nand applied like a plaister, it takes away\nfilthy scars, and the deformity the small\npox leaves behind them; being mixed with\noil of Roses, and dropped into the ears, it\nhelps pains there; being used as a pessary,\nit provokes the menses, and helps\nhardness or stiffness of the womb. It is\nsometimes used inwardly in such medicines\nas ease pains and help the cough: if you\nmix a little of it with old white wine and\ndrink it, it both provokes urine and stops\nlooseness or fluxes.\nDragons blood, cools, binds, and repels.\nAcasia, and Hyposistis, do the like.\nThe juice of Maudlin, or, for want of it\nCostmary, which is the same in effect, and\nbetter known to the vulgar, the juice is made\nthick for the better keeping of it; first\nclarify the juice before you boil it to its due\nthickness, which is something thicker than\nhoney.\nIt is appropriated to the liver, and the\nquantity of a dram taken every morning,\nhelps the Cachexia, or evil disposition of\nthe body proceeding from coldness of the\nliver: it helps the rickets and worms in\nchildren, provokes urine, and gently (without\npurging) disburdens the body of choler\nand flegm; it succours the lungs, opens obstructions,\nand resists putrifaction of blood.\nGums are either temperate, as, Lacca,\nElemi, Tragacanth, &c.\nIntemperate, and so are hot in the first\ndegree, as Bdellium, Gum of Ivy.\nIn the second, Galbanum, Myrrh, Mastich,\nFrankincense, Olibanum, Pitch, Rozin,\nStyrax.\nIn the third. Amoniacum.\nIn the fourth. Euphorbium.\nGum Arabick is cold.\nColophonia and Styrax soften.\nGum Arabick and Tragacanth, Sandarack\nor Juniper Gum, and Sarcocolla\nbind.\nGum of Cherry trees, breaks the stone.\nStyrax provokes the menses.\nOpopanax gently purges flegm.\nFrom the prickly Cedar when it is burned\ncomes forth that which, with us, is usually\nknown by the name of Tar, and is excellently\ngood for unction either for scabs, itch, or\nmanginess, either in men or beasts, as also\nagainst the leprosy, tetters, ringworms, and\nscald heads.\nAll sorts of Rozins fill up hollow ulcers,\nand relieve the body sore pressed with cold\ngriefs.\nThe Rozin of Pitch-tree, is that which\nis commonly called Burgundy pitch, and\nis something hotter and sharper than the\nformer, being spread upon a cloth is excellently\ngood for old aches coming of former\nbruises or dislocations.\nPitch mollifies hard swellings, and brings\nboils and sores to suppuration, it breaks\ncarbuncles, disperses aposthumes, cleanses\nulcers of corruption and fills them with\nflesh.\nBdellium heats and mollifies, and that very\ntemperately, being mixed with any convenient\nointment or plaister, it helps kernels\nin the neck and throat, Scrophula, or\nthat disease which was called the King’s\nEvil. Inwardly taken in any convenient\nmedicine, it provokes the menses, and breaks\nthe stone, it helps coughs and bitings of\nvenomous beasts: it helps windiness of the\nspleen, and pains in the sides thence coming.\nBoth outwardly applied to the place and\ninwardly taken, it helps ruptures or such as\nare burst, it softens the hardness of the\nwomb, dries up the moisture thereof and\nexpels the dead child.\nBitumen Jadaicum is a certain dry pitch\nwhich the dead sea, or lake of Sodom in India\ncasts forth at certain times, the inhabitants\nthereabouts pitch their ships with it. It is\nof excellent use to mollify the hardness of\nswellings and discuss them, as also against\ninflammations; the smoke of it burnt is\nexcellently good for the fits of the mother,\nand the falling-sickness: Inwardly taken in[272]\nwine it provokes the menses, helps the bitings\nof venomous beasts, and dissolves congealed\nblood in the body.\nAmbergreese is hot and dry in the second\ndegree, I will not dispute whether it be a\nGum or not: It strengthens nature much\nwhich way soever it be taken, there are but\nfew grains usually given of it at a time:\nmixed with a little ointment of Orange\nflowers, and the temples and forehead\nanointed with it, it eases the pains of the\nhead and strengthens the brain exceedingly;\nthe same applied to the privities, helps the\nfits of the mother; inwardly taken it\nstrengthens the brain and memory, the\nheart and vital spirit, warms cold stomachs,\nand is an exceeding strengthener of nature\nto old people, adding vigour to decayed and\nworn-out spirits: it provokes venery, and\nmakes barren women fruitful, if coldness\nand moisture or weakness be the cause impediting.\nAssafœtida being smelled to, is vulgarly\nknown to repress the fits of the mother;\na little bit put into an aching tooth, presently\neases the pain, ten grains of it taken\nbefore dinner, walking half an hour after\nit, provokes appetite, helps digestion,\nstrengthens the stomach, and takes away\nloathing of meat, it provokes lust exceedingly\nand expels wind as much.\nBorax, besides the virtues it has to solder\nGold, Silver, Copper, &c. inwardly given\nin small quantities, it stops fluxes, and the\nrunning of the reins: being in fine powder,\nand put into green wounds, it cures them at\nonce dressing.\nGambuge, which the College calls Gutta\nGamba. I know no good of it.\nCaranna outwardly applied, is excellent\nfor aches and swellings in the nerves and\njoints: If you lay it behind the ears, it\ndraws back humours from the eyes; applied\nto the temples as they usually do Mastich, it\nhelps the tooth-ache.\nGum Elimi, authors appropriate to fractures\nin the skull and head. See Arceus’\nliniment.\nGum Lacca being well purified, and the\nquantity of half a dram taken in any convenient\nliquor, strengthens the stomach and\nliver, opens obstructions, helps the yellow\njaundice and dropsy; provokes urine,\nbreaks the stone in the reins and bladder.\nLiquid Amber is not much unlike liquid\nStyrax: by unction it warms and comforts\na cold and moist brain, it eases all griefs\ncoming of a cold cause, it mightily comforts\nand strengthens a weak stomach, being\nanointed with it, and helps digestion exceedingly,\nit dissolves swellings. It is hot\nin the third degree, and moist in the first.\nI think it would do the commonwealth\nno harm if I should speak a word or two on\nManna here, although it be no Gum: I confess\nauthors make some flutter about it,\nwhat it is, some holding it to be the juice\nof a tree; I am confident it is the very same\ncondensated that our honey-dews here are,\nonly the contries whence it comes being far\nhotter, it falls in great abundance. Let him\nthat desires reason for it, be pleased to read\nButler’s book of Bees, a most excellent\nexperimental work, there he shall find reason\nenough to satisfy any reasonable man.\nChoose the driest and whitest; it is a very\ngentle purger of choler, quenches thirst,\nprovokes appetite, eases the roughness of\nthe throat, helps bitterness in the throat,\nand often proneness to vomit, it is very good\nfor such as are subject to be costive to put\nit into their drink instead of sugar, it hath\nno obnoxious quality at all in it, but may\nbe taken by a pregnant woman without any\ndanger; a child of a year old may take an\nounce of it at a time dissolved in milk, it\nwill melt like sugar, neither will it be known\nfrom it by the taste.\nMyrrh is hot and dry in the second degree,\ndangerous for pregnant women, it is bitter,\nand yet held to be good for the roughness\nof the throat and wind-pipe; half a dram [273]of\nit taken at a time helps rheumatic distillations\nupon the lungs, pains in the sides; it\nstops fluxes, provokes the menses, brings\naway both birth and after-birth, softens the\nhardness of the womb; being taken two\nhours before the fit comes, it helps agues.\nMathiolus saith he seldom used any other\nmedicine for the quartan ague than a dram\nof myrrh given in Muskadel an hour before\nthe fit usually came; if you make it up into\npills with treacle, and take one of them\nevery morning fasting, it is a sovereign\npreservative against the pestilence, against\nthe poison of serpents, and other venomous\nbeasts; a singular remedy for a stinking breath\nif it arise from putrefaction of the stomach,\nit fastens loose teeth, and stays the shedding\noff of the hair, outwardly used it breeds\nflesh in deep wounds, and covers the naked\nbones with flesh.\nOlibanum is hot in the second degree, and\ndry in the first, you may take a dram of it\nat a time, it stops looseness and the running\nof the reins; it strengthens the memory\nexceedingly, comforts the heart, expels sadness\nand melancholy, strengthens the heart,\nhelps coughs, rheums and pleurises; your\nbest way (in my opinion,) to take it is to mix\nit with conserve of roses, and take it in the\nmorning fasting.\nTachamacha is seldom taken inwardly,\noutwardly spread upon leather, and applied\nto the navel; it stays the fits of the mother,\napplied to the side, it mitigates speedily,\nand in little time quite takes away the pain\nand windiness of the spleen; the truth is,\nwhatsoever ache or swelling proceeds of\nwind or cold raw humours, I know no\nbetter plaister coming from beyond sea than\nthis gum. It strengthens the brain and\nmemory exceedingly, and stops all such\ndefluctions thence as trouble the eyes, ears,\nor teeth, it helps the gout and sciatica.\nGum Coopal, and Gum Anime, are very\nlike one another both in body and operation,\nthe former is hard to come by, the last\nnot very easy. It stops defluctions from\nthe head, if you perfume your cap with the\nsmoke of it, it helps the headache and\nmegrim, strengthens the brain, and therefore\nthe sinews.\nGum Tragaganth, which the vulgar call\nGum Dragon, being mixed with pectoral\nSyrups, (which you shall find noted in their\nproper places) it helps coughs and hoarseness,\nsalt and sharp distillations upon the\nlungs, being taken with a liquorice stick,\nbeing dissolved in sweet wine, it helps\n(being drank) gnawing in the bowels, sharpness\nand freetings of the urine, which causes\nexcoriations either in the reins or bladder,\nbeing dissolved in milk and the eyes washed\nwith it, it takes away weals and scabs that\ngrow on the eyelids, it is excellently good to\nbe put in poultice to fodder wounds,\nespecially if the nerves or sinews be hurt.\nSagapen, dissolved in juice of rue and\ntaken, wonderfully breaks the stone in the\nbladder, expels the dead child and afterbirth,\nclears the sight; dissolved in wine\nand drank, it helps the cough, and distillation\nupon the lungs, and the fits of the\nmother; outwardly in oils or ointments, it\nhelps such members as are out of joint or\nover-stretched.\nGalbanum is of the same operation, and\nalso taken from the same plant, viz. Fennel,\nGiant.\nGum Arabic, thickens and cools, and corrects\ncholeric sharp humours in the body,\nbeing dissolved in the white of an egg, well\nbeaten, it helps burnings, and keeps the\nplace from blistering.\nMastich stays fluxes, being taken inwardly\nany way. Three or four small grains of\nMastich, swallowed at night going to bed,\nis a remedy for pains in the stomach,\nbeing beaten into powder, and mixed with\nconserve of Roses, it strengthens the stomach,\nstops distillations upon the lungs, stay,\nvomiting, and causes a sweet breath; being\nmixed with white wine and the mouth[274]\nwashed with it, it cleanses the gums of corruption,\nand fastens loose teeth.\nFrankincense being used outwardly in the\nway of a plaister, heats and binds; being\napplied to the temples, stops the rheums\nthat flow to the eyes, helps green wounds,\nand fills hollow ulcers with flesh, stops the\nbleeding of wounds, though the arteries be\ncut; being made into an ointment with\nVinegar and Hog’s-grease, helps the itch,\npains in the ears, inflammations in women’s\nbreasts commonly called agues in the breast;\nbeware of taking it inwardly, lest it cause\nmadness.\nTurpentine is hot in the second degree, it\nheals, softens, it discusses and purges,\ncleanses the reins, provokes urine.\nStyrax Calamitis is hot and dry in the\nsecond degree, it heals, mollifies, and concocts;\nbeing taken inwardly helps the cough,\nand distillations of the lungs, hoarseness and\nloss of voice, helps the hardness of the\nwomb, and provokes the menses.\nAmmoniacum, hot and dry in the third\ndegree, softens, draws, and heats; being dissolved\nin vinegar, strained and applied\nplaister-wise, it takes away carbuncles and\nhardness in the flesh, it is one of the best\nremedies that I know for infirmities of the\nspleen, being applied to the left side; being\nmade into an ointment with oil, it is good\nto anoint the limbs of such as are weary:\na scruple of it being taken in the form of a\npill loosens the belly, gives speedy delivery\nto women in travail, helps diseases of the\nspleen, the sciatica and all pains in the\njoints, and have any humour afflicting their\nbreast.\nCamphire, it is held by all authority to be\ncold and dry in the third degree, it is of very\nthin subtile parts, insomuch that being\nbeaten into very fine powder it will vanquish\naway into the air, being beaten into powder\nand mixed with oil, and the temples anointed\ntherewith, eases headaches proceeding of\nheat, all inflammations whatsoever, the back\nbeing anointed with the same, cools the reins,\nand seminal vessels, stops the running of\nthe reins and Fluor Albus, the moderate use\nof Venery, the like it doth if it be drank\ninwardly with Bettony-water, take but a\nsmall quantity of it at a time inwardly, it\nresist poison and bitings by venomous\nbeasts; outwardly, applied as before, and\nthe eyes anointed with it, stops hot rheums\nthat flow thither.\nOpopanax purges thick flegm from the\nmost remote parts of the body, viz. the\nbrain, joints, hands, and feet, the nerves\nand breast, and strengthens all those parts\nwhen they are weak, if the weakness proceed\nof cold, as usually it doth; it helps\nweakness of the sight, old rotten coughs,\nand gouts of all sorts, dropsies, and swellings\nof the spleen, it helps the stranguary\nand difficulty of making urine, provokes\nthe menses, and helps all cold afflictions of\nthe womb; have a care you give it not to\nany pregnant women. The dose is one\ndram at most, corrected with a little Mastich,\ndissolved in Vinegar and outwardly applied\nhelps the passions of the spleen.\nIn the next place the College tells you a tale\nconcerning Liquid, Juices, and Tears,\nwhich are to be kept for present use, viz.\nCollege.] Vinegar, Juice of Citrons, Juice\nof sour Grapes, Oranges, Barberries, Tears of\na Birch-tree, Juice of Cherries, Quinces, Pomegranates,\nLemons, Wood-sorrel, Oil of unripe\nOlives, and ripe Olives, both new and old, Juice\nof red and Damask Roses, Wine Tears of a\nVine.\nCulpeper.] The virtues of the most of\nthese may be found in the Syrups, and are\nfew of them used alone.\n[275]\nThen the College tells you there are things\nbred of PLANTS.\nCollege.] Agarick, Jew’s-ears, the berries\nof Chermes, the Spungy substance of the\nBriar, Moss, Viscus Quercinus, Oak, Apples.\nCulpeper.] As the College would have\nyou know this, so would I know what the\nchief of them are good for.\nJew’s-ears boiled in milk and drank,\nhelps sore throats.\nMoss is cold, dry, and binding, therefore\ngood for fluxes of all sorts.\nMisleto of the Oak, it helps the falling\nsickness and the

not\nbeen pleased to learn, may be made beneficial\nto your sick bodies, be pleased to\nunderstand, that\nBees being burnt to ashes, and a lye made\nwith the ashes, trimly decks a bald head\nbeing washed with it.\nSnails with shells on their backs, being\nfirst washed from the dirt, then the shells\nbroken, and they boiled in spring water,\nbut not scummed at all, for the scum will\nsink of itself, and the water drank for\nordinary drink is a most admirable remedy\nfor consumption; being bruised and applied\nto the place they help the gout, draw\nthorns out of the flesh, and held to the nose\nhelp the bleeding thereof.\nTherefore consider that the College gave\nthe Apothecaries a catalogue of what\nParts of Living creatures and Excrements\nthey must keep in their shops.\nCollege.]

Dodder, Hart’s-tongue,\nTamarisk, Time.\nHaving thus ended the appropriation,\nI shall speak briefly of the virtues of distilled\nwaters.\nLettice water cools the blood when it is\nover-heated, for when it is not, it needs no\ncooling: it cools the head and liver, stays\nhot vapours ascending to the head, and\nhinders sleep; it quenches immoderate\nthirst, and breeds milk in nurses, distil it in\nMay.\nPurslain water cools the blood and liver,\nquenches thirst, helps such as spit blood,\nhave hot coughs, or pestilences.\nThe distilled water of water Lily-flowers[280]\ncools the blood and the bowels, and all\ninternal parts of the body; helps such as\nhave the yellow jaundice, hot coughs and\npleurisies, the head-ache, coming of heat,\nfevers pestilential and not pestilential, as\nalso hectic fevers.\nThe water of Violet flowers, cools the\nblood, the heart, liver and lungs, over-heated,\nand quenches an insatiable desire\nof drinking, they are in their prime about\nthe latter end of March, or beginning of\nApril, according as the year falls out.\nThe water of Sorrel cools the blood,\nheart, liver, and spleen: If Venice Treacle\nbe given with it, it is profitable in pestilential\nfevers, distil it in May.\nEndive and Succory water are excellent\nagainst heat in the stomach; if you take\nan ounce of either (for their operation is\nthe same) morning and evening, four days\none after another, they cool the liver, and\ncleanse the blood: they are in their prime\nin May.\nFumitory water is usual with the city\ndames to wash their faces with, to take away\nmorphey, freckles, and sun-burning; inwardly\ntaken, it helps the yellow jaundice\nand itch, cleanses the blood, provokes\nsweat, strengthens the stomach, and cleanses\nthe body of adust humours: it is in its\nprime in May and June.\nThe water of Nightshade helps pains in\nthe head coming of heat. Take heed you\ndistil not the deadly Nightshade instead of\nthe common, if you do, you may make\nmad work. Let such as have not wit\nenough to know them asunder, have wit\nenough to let them both alone till they do.\nThe water of white Poppies extinguishes\nall heat against nature, helps head-aches\ncoming of heat, and too long standing in\nthe sun.

It is usually given in diseases\nof the brain, as convulsions, falling-sickness,\npalsy and apoplexy.\nBetony is in its prime in May, the distilled[281]\nwater thereof is very good for such\nas are pained in their heads, it prevails\nagainst the dropsy and all sorts of fevers;\nit succours the liver and spleen, and helps\nwant of digestion and evil disposition of\nthe body thence arising; it hastens travail\nin women with child, and is excellent\nagainst the bitings of venomous beasts.\nDistil Sage whilst the flowers be on it,\nthe water strengthens the brain, provokes the\nmenses, helps nature much in all its actions.\nMarjoram is in its prime in June, distilled\nwater is excellent for such whose\nbrains are too cold, it provokes urine, heats\nthe womb, provokes the menses, strengthens\nthe memory and helps the judgment, causes\nan able brain.\nDistil Camomel water about the beginning\nof June.

SPIRIT AND COMPOUND DISTILLED WATERS.\nCulpeper.] Before I begin these, I\nthought good to premise a few words: They\nare all hot in operation, and therefore not\nto be meddled with by people of hot constitutions\nwhen they are in health, for fear\nof fevers and adustion of blood, but for\npeople of cold constitutions, as melancholy\nand flegmatic people. If they drink of\nthem moderately now and then for recreation,\ndue consideration being had to the\npart of the body which is weakest, they\nmay do them good: yet in diseases of\nmelancholy, neither strong waters nor sack\nis to be drank, for they make the humour\nthin, and then up to the head it flies, where\nit fills the brain with foolish and fearful\nimaginations.\n2. Let all young people forbear them\nwhilst they are in health, for their blood is\nusually hot enough without them.\n3. Have regard to the season of the year,\nso shall you find them more beneficial in\nSummer than in Winter, because in summer\nthe body is always coldest within, and\ndigestion weakest, and that is the reason\nwhy men and women eat less in Summer\nthan in Winter.\nThus much for people in health, which\ndrink strong waters for recreation.\nAs for the medicinal use of them, it shall\nbe shewed at the latter end of every receipt,\nonly in general they are (due respect had\nto the humours afflicting, and part of the\nbody afflicted) medicinal for diseases of\ncold and flegm, chilliness of the spirits,\n&c.\nBut that my countrymen may not be\nmistaken in this, I shall give them some\nsymptoms of each complexion how a man\nmay know when it exceeds its due limits.\nSigns of choler abounding.\nLeanness of body, costiveness, hollow\neyes, anger without a cause, a testy disposition,\nyellowness of the skin, bitterness in\nthe throat, pricking pains in the head, the\npulse swifter and stronger than ordinary,\nthe urine higher coloured, thinner and brighter,\ntroublesome sleeps, much dreaming of\nfire, lightning, anger, and fighting.\nSigns of blood abounding.\nThe veins are bigger (or at least they\nseem so) and fuller then ordinary; the skin\nis red, and as it were swollen; pricking\npains in the sides, and about the temples,\nshortness of breath, head-ache, the pulse\ngreat and full, urine high coloured and\nthick, dreams of blood, &c.\nSigns of melancholy abounding.\nFearfulness without a cause, fearful and\nfoolish imaginations, the skin rough and\nswarthy, leanness, want of sleep, frightful\ndreams, sourness in the throat, the pulse\nvery weak, solitariness, thin clear urine,\noften sighing, &c.\nSigns of flegm abounding.\nSleepiness, dulness, slowness, heaviness,\ncowardliness, forgetfulness, much spitting,\nmuch superfluities at the nose, little appetite\nto meat and as bad digestion, the skin\nwhiter, colder and smoother than it was\nwant to be; the pulse slow and deep: the\nurine thick and low coloured: dreams of\nrain, floods, and water, &c.\nThese things thus premised, I come to\nthe matter.\nThe first the College presents you with,\nis\nSpiritus et Aqua Absinthis minus Composita.\nOr, Spirit and water of Wormwood, the\nlesser composition.[284]\nCollege.] Take of the leaves of dryed\nWormwood two pounds, Annis seeds, half\na pound: steep them in six gallons of small\nwine twenty four hours, then distil them\nin an Alembick, adding to every pound of\nthe distilled water two ounces of the best\nSugar.\nLet the two first pound you draw out be\ncalled Spirit of Wormwood, those which\nfollow, Wormwood water the lesser composition.\nCulpeper.] I like this distinction of the\nCollege very well, because what is first\nstilled out, is far stronger than the rest,\nand therefore very fitting to be kept by\nitself: you may take which you please,\naccording as the temperature of your body,\neither to heat or cold, and the season of\nyear requires.\nIt hath the same virtues Wormwood\nhath, only fitter to be used by such whose\nbodies are chilled by age, and whose\nnatural heat abates. You may search the\nherbs for the virtues, it heats the stomach,\nand helps digestion.\nThe College.] After the same manner\n(only omitting the Annis seeds) is distilled\nspirit and water of Angelica, both Herb\nand Root, Bawm, Mints, Sage, &c. the\nFlowers of Rosemary, Clary, Clove-gilliflowers,\n&c. the seeds of Caraway, &c.\nJuniper-berries, Orange Pills, Lemons,\nCitrons, &c.

SPIRIT AND COMPOUND DISTILLED WATERS.\nCulpeper.] Before I begin these, I\nthought good to premise a few words: They\nare all hot in operation, and therefore not\nto be meddled with by people of hot constitutions\nwhen they are in health, for fear\nof fevers and adustion of blood, but for\npeople of cold constitutions, as melancholy\nand flegmatic people. If they drink of\nthem moderately now and then for recreation,\ndue consideration being had to the\npart of the body which is weakest, they\nmay do them good: yet in diseases of\nmelancholy, neither strong waters nor sack\nis to be drank, for they make the humour\nthin, and then up to the head it flies, where\nit fills the brain with foolish and fearful\nimaginations.\n2. Let all young people forbear them\nwhilst they are in health, for their blood is\nusually hot enough without them.\n3. Have regard to the season of the year,\nso shall you find them more beneficial in\nSummer than in Winter, because in summer\nthe body is always coldest within, and\ndigestion weakest, and that is the reason\nwhy men and women eat less in Summer\nthan in Winter.\nThus much for people in health, which\ndrink strong waters for recreation.\nAs for the medicinal use of them, it shall\nbe shewed at the latter end of every receipt,\nonly in general they are (due respect had\nto the humours afflicting, and part of the\nbody afflicted) medicinal for diseases of\ncold and flegm, chilliness of the spirits,\n&c.\nBut that my countrymen may not be\nmistaken in this, I shall give them some\nsymptoms of each complexion how a man\nmay know when it exceeds its due limits.\nSigns of choler abounding.\nLeanness of body, costiveness, hollow\neyes, anger without a cause, a testy disposition,\nyellowness of the skin, bitterness in\nthe throat, pricking pains in the head, the\npulse swifter and stronger than ordinary,\nthe urine higher coloured, thinner and brighter,\ntroublesome sleeps, much dreaming of\nfire, lightning, anger, and fighting.\nSigns of blood abounding.\nThe veins are bigger (or at least they\nseem so) and fuller then ordinary; the skin\nis red, and as it were swollen; pricking\npains in the sides, and about the temples,\nshortness of breath, head-ache, the pulse\ngreat and full, urine high coloured and\nthick, dreams of blood, &c.\nSigns of melancholy abounding.\nFearfulness without a cause, fearful and\nfoolish imaginations, the skin rough and\nswarthy, leanness, want of sleep, frightful\ndreams, sourness in the throat, the pulse\nvery weak, solitariness, thin clear urine,\noften sighing, &c.\nSigns of flegm abounding.\nSleepiness, dulness, slowness, heaviness,\ncowardliness, forgetfulness, much spitting,\nmuch superfluities at the nose, little appetite\nto meat and as bad digestion, the skin\nwhiter, colder and smoother than it was\nwant to be; the pulse slow and deep: the\nurine thick and low coloured: dreams of\nrain, floods, and water, &c.\nThese things thus premised, I come to\nthe matter.\nThe first the College presents you with,\nis\nSpiritus et Aqua Absinthis minus Composita.\nOr, Spirit and water of Wormwood, the\nlesser composition.[284]\nCollege.] Take of the leaves of dryed\nWormwood two pounds, Annis seeds, half\na pound: steep them in six gallons of small\nwine twenty four hours, then distil them\nin an Alembick, adding to every pound of\nthe distilled water two ounces of the best\nSugar.\nLet the two first pound you draw out be\ncalled Spirit of Wormwood, those which\nfollow, Wormwood water the lesser composition.\nCulpeper.] I like this distinction of the\nCollege very well, because what is first\nstilled out, is far stronger than the rest,\nand therefore very fitting to be kept by\nitself: you may take which you please,\naccording as the temperature of your body,\neither to heat or cold, and the season of\nyear requires.\nIt hath the same virtues Wormwood\nhath, only fitter to be used by such whose\nbodies are chilled by age, and whose\nnatural heat abates.

A Syrup is a medicine of\na liquid body, compounded of Decoction,\nInfusion, or Juice, with Sugar or Honey,\nand brought by the heat of the fire, into\nthe thickness of Honey. 2. Because all\nHoney is not of a thickness, understand\nnew Honey, which of all other is thinnest.\n3. The reason why Decoctions, Infusions,\nJuices, are thus used, is, Because thereby,\nFirst, They will keep the longer. Secondly,\nThey will taste the better. 4. In boiling\nSyrups have a great care of their just consistence,\nfor if you boil them too much[295]\nthey will candy, if too little, they will sour.\n5. All simple Syrups have the virtues of\nthe simples they are made of, and are far\nmore convenient for weak people, and\ndelicate stomachs.\nSyrupus de Absinthio simplex.\nOr Syrup of Wormwood simple.\nThe College.] Take of the clarified Juice\nof common Wormwood, clarified Sugar, of\neach four pounds, make it into a Syrup according\nto art. After the same manner,\nare prepared simple Syrups of Betony,\nBorrage, Bugloss, Carduus, Chamomel,\nSuccory, Endive, Hedge-mustard, Strawberries,\nFumitory, Ground Ivy, St. John’s\nWort, Hops, Mercury, Mousear, Plantain,\nApples, Purslain, Rasberries, Sage, Scabious,\nScordium, Houseleek, Colt’s-foot,\nPaul’s Bettony, and other Juices not sour.\nCulpeper.] See the simples, and then\nyou may easily know both their virtues, and\nalso that they are pleasanter and fitter for\ndelicate stomachs when they are made into\nSyrups.\nSyrupus de Absinthio Compositus.\nOr Syrup of Wormwood compound.\nCollege.] Take of common Wormwood\nmeanly dry, half a pound, red Roses two\nounces, Indian Spikenard three drams,\nold white Wine, juice of Quinces, of each\ntwo pounds and an half, steep them a whole\nday in an earthen vessel, then boil them\ngently, and strain it, and by adding two\npounds of sugar, boil it into a Syrup according\nto art.\nCulpeper.] Mesue is followed verbatim\nin this; and the receipt is appropriated to\ncold and flegmatic stomachs, and it is an\nadmirable remedy for it, for it strengthens\nboth stomach and liver, as also the instruments\nof concoction, a spoonful taken in\nthe morning, is admirable for such as have\na weak digestion, it provokes an appetite to\none’s victuals, it prevails against the yellow\niaundice, breaks wind, purges humours by\nurine.\nSyrupus de Acetosus simplex.\nOr Syrup of Vinegar simple.\nCollege.] Take of clear Water four\npounds, white Sugar five pounds, boil them\nin a glazed vessel over a gentle fire, scumming\nit till half the water be consumed, then\nby putting in two pounds of white Wine\nVinegar by degrees, perfect the Syrup.\nCulpeper.] That is, only melt the Sugar\nwith the Vinegar over the fire, scum it, but\nboil it not.\nSyrupus Acetosus simplicior.\nOr Syrup of Vinegar more simple.\nCollege.] Take of white Sugar five\npounds, white Wine Vinegar two pounds,\nby melting it in a bath, make it into a\nSyrup.\nCulpeper.] Of these two Syrups let every\none use which he finds by experience to be\nbest; the difference is but little. They\nboth of them cut flegm, as also tough,\nhard viscous humours in the stomach; they\ncool the body, quench thirst, provoke urine,\nand prepare the stomach before the taking\nof a vomit. If you take it as a preparative\nfor an emetic, take half an ounce of it when\nyou go to bed the night before you intend\nit to operate, it will work the easier, but if for\nany of the foregoing occasions, take it with\na liquorice stick.\nSyrupus Acetosus compositus.\nOr Syrup of Vinegar compound.\nCollege.] Take of the roots of Smallage,\nFennel, Endive, of each three ounces, the\nseeds of Annis, Smallage, Fennel, of each\none ounce, of Endive half an ounce, clear\nWater six pounds, boil it gently in an earthen\nvessel till half the water be consumed, then\nstrain and clarify it, and with three pounds\nof Sugar, and a pound and a half of white\nWine Vinegar, boil it into a Syrup.\nCulpeper.] This in my opinion is a\ngallant Syrup for such whose bodies are\nstuffed either with flegm, or tough humours,\nfor it opens obstructions or stoppings both\nof the stomach, liver, spleen, and reins;[296]\nit cuts and brings away tough flegm and\ncholer, and is therefore a special remedy\nfor such as have a stuffing at their stomach.\nSyrupus de Agno Casto.\nOr Syrup of Agnus Castus.\nCollege.] Take of the seeds of Rue and\nHemp, of each half a dram, of Endive,\nLettice, Purslain, Gourds, Melons, of each\ntwo drams, of Fleawort half an ounce, of\nAgnus Castus four ounces, the flowers of\nWater Lilies, the leaves of Mints, of each\nhalf a handful, decoction of seeds of Lentils,\nand Coriander seeds, of each half an ounce,\nthree pounds of the decoction, boil them\nall over a gentle fire till two pounds be consumed,\nadd to the residue, being strained,\ntwo ounces of juice of Lemons, a pound\nand a half of white sugar, make it into a\nSyrup according to art.\nCulpeper.] A pretty Syrup, and good for\nlittle.\nSyrupus de Althæa.\nOr Syrup of Marsh-mallows.\nCollege.] Take of roots of Marsh-mallows,\ntwo ounces, the roots of Grass Asparagus,\nLiquorice, Raisins of the Sun stoned,\nof each half an ounce, the tops of Mallows,\nMarsh-mallows, Pellitory of the Wall,\nBurnet, Plantain, Maiden-hair white and\nblack, of each a handful, red Cicers an\nounce, of the four greater and four lesser\ncold seeds, of each three drams, boil them\nin six pounds of clear Water till four remain,\nwhich being strained, boil into a syrup with\nfour pounds of white sugar.\nCulpeper.] It is a fine cooling, opening,\nslipery Syrup, and chiefly commendable for\nthe cholic, stone, or gravel, in the kidneys\nor bladder.\nSyrupus de Ammoniaca.\nOr Syrup of Ammoniacum.\nCollege.] Take of Maudlin and Cetrach,\nof each four handfuls, common Wormwood\nan ounce, the roots of Succory, Sparagus,\nbark of Caper roots, of each two ounces,\nafter due preparation steep them twenty-four\nhours in three ounces of white Wine,\nRadish and Fumitory water, of each two\npounds, then boil it away to one pound\neight ounces, let it settle, in four ounces of\nwhich, whilst it is warm, dissolve by itself\nGum Ammoniacum, first dissolved in white\nWine Vinegar, two ounces, boil the rest\nwith a pound and an half of white sugar\ninto a Syrup, adding the mixtures of the\nGum at the end.\nCulpeper.] It cools the liver, and opens\nobstructions both of it and the spleen, helps\nold surfeits, and such like diseases, as scabs,\nitch, leprosy, and what else proceed from\nthe liver over heated.

    "cleaned_text": "ALTERING SYRUPS.\nCulpeper.] Reader, before we begin\nwith the particular Syrups, I think good to\nadvertise thee of these few things, which\nconcern the nature, making, and use of Syrups\nin general. 1. A Syrup is a medicine of\na liquid body, compounded of Decoction,\nInfusion, or Juice, with Sugar or Honey,\nand brought by the heat of the fire, into\nthe thickness of Honey. 2. Because all\nHoney is not of a thickness, understand\nnew Honey, which of all other is thinnest.\n3. The reason why Decoctions, Infusions,\nJuices, are thus used, is, Because thereby,\nFirst, They will keep the longer. Secondly,\nThey will taste the better. 4. In boiling\nSyrups have a great care of their just consistence,\nfor if you boil them too much[295]\nthey will candy, if too little, they will sour.\n5. All simple Syrups have the virtues of\nthe simples they are made of, and are far\nmore convenient for weak people, and\ndelicate stomachs.\nSyrupus de Absinthio simplex.\nOr Syrup of Wormwood simple.\nThe College.] Take of the clarified Juice\nof common Wormwood, clarified Sugar, of\neach four pounds, make it into a Syrup according\nto art.

    "full_text": "SECTION I.\nOf the Temperature of Medicines.\nHerbs, plants, and other medicines manifestly\noperate, either by heat, coldness, dryness,\nor moisture, for the world being composed\nof so many qualities, they and only\nthey can be found in the world, and the\nmixtures of them one with another.\nBut that they may appear as clear as the\nsun when he is upon the meridian, I shall\ntreat of them severally, and in this order[377]\n1. Of Medicines temperate.\n2. Of Medicines hot.\n3. Of Medicines cold.\n4. Of Medicines moist.\n5. Of Medicines dry.\nOf Medicines Temperate.\nIf the world be composed of extremes,\nthen it acts by extremes, for as the man is,\nso is his work: therefore it is impossible\nthat any medicine can be temperate, but\nmay be reduced to heat, cold, dryness, or\nmoisture, and must operate, (I mean such as\noperate by manifest quality) by one of these,\nbecause there is no other to operate by, and\nthat there should be such a temperate mixture,\nso exquisitely of these qualities in any\nmedicine, that one of them should not\nmanifestly excel the other, I doubt it is a\nsystem too rare to find.\nThus then I conclude the matter to be,\nthose Medicines are called temperate (not\nbecause they have no excess of temperature\nat all in them) which can neither be said,\nto heat nor cool so much as will amount to\nthe first degree of excess, for daily experience\nwitnesses that they being added to\nmedicines, change not their qualities, they\nmake them neither hotter nor colder.\nTheir use. They are used in such diseases\nwhere there is no manifest distemper\nof the first qualities, viz. heat and cold,\nfor example; In obstruction of the bowels,\nwhere cold medicines might make the obstruction\ngreater, and hot medicines cause a\nfever.\nIn fevers of flegm, where the cause is\ncold and moist, and the effect hot and dry;\nin such, use temperate medicines which may\nneither encrease the fever by their heat,\nnor condensate the flegm by their coldness.\nBesides, because contraries are taken\naway by their contraries, and every like\nmaintained by its like, they are of great\nuse, to preserve the constitution of the body\ntemperate, and the body itself in strength\nand vigour, and may be used without danger,\nor fear of danger, by considering which\npart of the body is weak, and using such\ntemperate medicines as are appropriated to\nthat part.\nOf Medicines hot.\nThe care of the ancient Physicians was\nsuch that they did not labour to hide from,\nbut impart to posterity, not only the temperature\nof medicines in general, but also\ntheir degrees in temperature, that so the\ndistempered part may be brought to its\ntemperature, and no further; for all things\nwhich are of a contrary temperature, conduce\nnot to cure, but the strength of the\ncontrariety must be observed, that so the\nmedicine may be neither weaker nor stronger,\nthan just to take away the distemper;\nfor if the distemper be but meanly hot, and\nyou apply a medicine cold in the fourth\ndegree, it is true, you may soon remove that\ndistemper of heat, and bring another of\ncold twice as bad. Galen, de simp. med. facul.\nlib. 3. cap. 12.\nThen, secondly, Not only the distemper\nitself, but also the part of the body distempered\nmust be heeded; for if the head\nbe distempered by heat, and you give such\nmedicines as cool the heart or liver, you will\nbring another disease, and not cure the\nformer.\nThe degrees then of temperature are to\nbe diligently heeded, which antient physicians\nhave concluded to be four in the qualities,\nviz. heat and cold, of each we shall\nspeak a word or two severally.\nOf Medicines hot in the first degree.\nThose are said to be hot in the first degree,\nwhich induce a moderate and natural\nheat to the body, and to the parts thereof;\neither cold by nature, or cooled by accident,\nby which natural heat is cherished when\nweak, or restored when wanting.\nEffect 1. The first effect then of medicines\nhot in the first degree, is, by their\nsweet and temperate heat to reduce the[378]\nbody to its natural heat, as the fire doth the\nexternal parts in cold weather, unless the\naffliction of cold be so great that such mild\nmedicines will not serve the turn.\nEffect 2. The second effect is, the mitigation\nof pain arising from such a distemper,\nand indeed this effect hath other medicines,\nsome that are cold, and some that are hotter\nthan the first degree, they being rationally\napplied to the distemper. These medicines\nthe Greeks call Anodyna, and shall be spoken\nof in their proper places. In this\nplace let it suffice that medicines hot in the\nfirst degree, make the offending humours\nthin, and expel them by sweat, or insensible\ntranspiration, and these of all others are\nmost congruous or agreeable to the body of\nman, for there is no such equal temperature\nof heat and cold in a sound man, but heat\nexceeds, for we live by heat and moisture,\nand not by cold.\nMedicines then which are hot in the first\ndegree, are such as just correspond to the\nnatural heat of our bodies; such as are\nhotter or colder, are more subject to do mischief,\nbeing administered by an unskilful\nhand, than these are, because of their contrariety\nto nature; whereas these are grateful\nto the body by their moderate heat.\nEffect 3. Thirdly, These take away\nweariness, and help fevers, being outwardly\napplied, because they open the pores of the\nskin, and by their gentle heat prepare the\nhumours, and take away those fuliginous\nvapours that are caused by fevers.\nDiscommodities.] Yet may discommodities\narise by heedless giving even of these,\nwhich I would have young students in physic\nto be very careful in, lest they do more\nmischief than they are aware of, viz. It is\npossible by too much use of them, to consume\nnot only what is inimical in the body,\nbut also the substance itself, and the strength\nof the spirits, whence comes faintings, and\nsometimes death: besides, by applying\nthem to the parts of the body they are not\nappropriated to, or by not heeding well the\ncomplexion of the patient, or the natural\ntemper of the part of the body afflicted, for\nthe heart is hot, but the brain temperate.\nEffect 4. Lastly, Medicines hot in the\nfirst degree, cherish heat in the internal\nparts, help concoction, breed good blood,\nand keep it good in temper, being bred.\nOf Medicines hot in the second degree.\nThese are something hotter than the\nnatural temper of a man.\nUse. Their use for such whose stomachs\nare filled with moisture, because their\nfaculty is too hot and dry; they take away\nobstructions or stoppings, open the pores\nof the skin, but not in the same manner\nthat such do as are hot in the first degree,\nfor they do it without force, by a gentle heat,\nconcocting, and expelling the humours, by\nstrengthening and helping nature in the\nwork; but these cut tough humours, and\nscatter them by their own force and power\nwhen nature cannot.\nOf Medicines hot in the third degree.\nThose which attain the third degree of\nheat, have the same faculties with those\nbefore mentioned; but as they are hotter,\nso are they more powerful in their operations,\nfor they are so powerful in heating\nand cutting, that if unadvisedly given they\ncause fevers. Use. Their use is to cut\ntough and compacted humours, to provoke\nsweat abundantly; hence it comes to pass\nthey all of them resist poison.\nOf Medicines hot in the fourth degree.\nThose medicines obtain the highest degree\nof heat, which are so hot that they burn the\nbody of a man, being outwardly applied to\nit, and cause inflammations, or raise blisters,\nas Crowfoot, Mustard-seed, Onions, &c.\nOf these more hereafter.\nOf cooling Medicines.\nPhysicians have also observed four degrees\nof coldness in medicines, which I shall\nbriefly treat of in order.[379]\nOf Medicines cold in the first degree.\nThose medicines which are least cold of\nall, obtain the first degree of coldness; and\nI beseech you take notice of this, that seeing\nour bodies are nourished by heat, and\nwe live by heat, therefore no cold medicines\nare friendly to the body, but what\ngood they do our bodies, they do it by removing\nan unnatural heat, or the body\nheated above its natural temper.\nThe giving then of cold medicines to a\nman in his natural temper, the season of\nthe year also being but moderately hot, extinguishes\nnatural heat in the body of man.\nYet have these a necessary use in them\ntoo, though not so frequent as hot medicines\nhave; and that may be the reason\nwhy an all wise God hath furnished us with\nfar more hot herbs and plants, &c. than\ncold.\nUse 1. Their use is first, in nourishment,\nthat so the heat of food may be qualified,\nand made for a weak stomach to digest.\nUse 2. Secondly, To restrain and assuage\nthe heat of the bowels, and to cool the\nblood in fevers.\nTherefore if the distemper of heat be but\ngentle, medicines cold in the first degree\nwill suffice; also children, and such people\nwhose stomachs are weak, are easily hurt\nby cold medicines.\nOf Medicines cold in the second and third degree.\nUse 1. Such whose stomachs are strong,\nand livers hot, may easily bear such medicines\nas are cold in the second degree, and\nin cases of extremity find much help by\nthem: as also by such as are cold in the\nthird degree, the extremity of the disease\nconsidered, for by both these the unbridled\nheat of choler is assuaged.\nUse 2. Also they are outwardly applied\nto hot swellings, due consideration being\nhad, that if the inflammation be not great,\nuse those that are less; if the inflammation\nbe vehement, make use of medicines cold\nin the second or third degree, always let\nthe remedy correspond to the just proportion\nof the affliction.\nUse 3. Thirdly, Sometimes the spirits\nare moved inordinately through heat, thence\nfollows immoderate watchings, if not deprivation\nof the senses, this also must be\nremedied with cold medicines, for cold\nstops the pores of the skin, makes the\nhumours thick, represses sweat, and keeps\nup the spirits from fainting.\nOf Medicines cold in the fourth degree.\nLastly, The use of medicines cold in the\nfourth degree, is, To mitigate desperate and\nvehement pains, stupifying the senses, when\nno other course can be taken to save life:\nof the use of which more hereafter.\nOf moistening Medicines.\nThere can be no such difference found\namongst moistening medicines, that they\nshould surpass the second degree. For seeing\nall medicines are either hot or cold,\nneither heat nor cold, seeing they are extremes,\ncan consist with moisture, for the\none dries it up, the other condensates it.\nUse. Phylosophers therefore call moisture\nand dryness, passive qualities, yet have\nthey their operation likewise; for moist\nmedicines lenify and make slippery, ease\nthe cough, and help the roughness of the\nthroat. These operations are proper to\nmedicines moist in the first degree.\nThose which are moister, take away\nnaturally strength, help the sharpness of\nhumours, make both blood and spirits\nthicker, looses the belly, and fits it for purgation.\nThe immoderate or indiscreet use of them\ndulls the body, and makes it unfit for action.\nOf drying Medicines.\nDrying medicines have contrary faculties\nto these, viz. To consume moisture, stop\nfluxes, and make such parts dry as are\nslippery, they make the body and members\nfirm, when they are weakened by too much[380]\nmoisture, that so they may perform their\nproper functions.\nYet although the members be strengthened\nby drying medicines, they have notwithstanding\ntheir own proper moisture in\nthem, which ought to be conserved, and not\ndestroyed, for without it they cannot consist:\nIf then this moisture be consumed by\nusing, or rather over use of drying medicines,\nthe members can neither be nourished,\nnor yet perform their proper actions.\nSuch medicines as are dry in the third\ndegree, being unadvisedly given, hinder\nthe parts of the body they are appropriated\nto, of their nourishment, and by that means\nbrings them into consumption.\nBesides, There is a certain moisture in\nthe body of man, which is called radical\nmoisture, which being taken away, the parts\nmust needs die, seeing natural heat and life\nalso consists in it, and this may be done by\ntoo frequent use of medicines dry in the\nfourth degree: And it may be this was the\nreason of Galen’s writing, that things dry\nin the fourth degree, must of necessity burn;\nwhich is an effect of heat, and not of dryness,\nunless by burning, Galen means consuming\nthe radical moisture.\nThe use then of drying medicines, is only\nto such bodies, and parts of the body, as\nabound with moisture, in which observe\nthese rules.\n1. If the moisture be not extreme, let not\nthe medicine be extremely drying.\n2. Let it be proper to the part of the\nbody afflicted, for if the liver be afflicted\nby moisture, and you go about to dry the\nbrain or heart, you may sooner kill than\ncure.\nThus have we briefly spoken of the first\nqualities of medicines, and in the general\nonly, and but briefly, because we shall\nalways touch upon them in the exposition\nof the other qualities, in which you must\nalways have an eye to these.\n",
    "cleaned_text": "SECTION I.\nOf the Temperature of Medicines.\nHerbs, plants, and other medicines manifestly\noperate, either by heat, coldness, dryness,\nor moisture, for the world being composed\nof so many qualities, they and only\nthey can be found in the world, and the\nmixtures of them one with another.\nBut that they may appear as clear as the\nsun when he is upon the meridian, I shall\ntreat of them severally, and in this order[377]\n1. Of Medicines temperate.\n2. Of Medicines hot.\n3. Of Medicines cold.\n4. Of Medicines moist.\n5. Of Medicines dry.\nOf Medicines Temperate.\nIf the world be composed of extremes,\nthen it acts by extremes, for as the man is,\nso is his work: therefore it is impossible\nthat any medicine can be temperate, but\nmay be reduced to heat, cold, dryness, or\nmoisture, and must operate, (I mean such as\noperate by manifest quality) by one of these,\nbecause there is no other to operate by, and\nthat there should be such a temperate mixture,\nso exquisitely of these qualities in any\nmedicine, that one of them should not\nmanifestly excel the other, I doubt it is a\nsystem too rare to find.\nThus then I conclude the matter to be,\nthose Medicines are called temperate (not\nbecause they have no excess of temperature\nat all in them) which can neither be said,\nto heat nor cool so much as will amount to\nthe first degree of excess, for daily experience\nwitnesses that they being added to\nmedicines, change not their qualities, they\nmake them neither hotter nor colder.\nTheir use. They are used in such diseases\nwhere there is no manifest distemper\nof the first qualities, viz. heat and cold,\nfor example; In obstruction of the bowels,\nwhere cold medicines might make the obstruction\ngreater, and hot medicines cause a\nfever.\nIn fevers of flegm, where the cause is\ncold and moist, and the effect hot and dry;\nin such, use temperate medicines which may\nneither encrease the fever by their heat,\nnor condensate the flegm by their coldness.\nBesides, because contraries are taken\naway by their contraries, and every like\nmaintained by its like, they are of great\nuse, to preserve the constitution of the body\ntemperate, and the body itself in strength\nand vigour, and may be used without danger,\nor fear of danger, by considering which\npart of the body is weak, and using such\ntemperate medicines as are appropriated to\nthat part.\nOf Medicines hot.\nThe care of the ancient Physicians was\nsuch that they did not labour to hide from,\nbut impart to posterity, not only the temperature\nof medicines in general, but also\ntheir degrees in temperature, that so the\ndistempered part may be brought to its\ntemperature, and no further; for all things\nwhich are of a contrary temperature, conduce\nnot to cure, but the strength of the\ncontrariety must be observed, that so the\nmedicine may be neither weaker nor stronger,\nthan just to take away the distemper;\nfor if the distemper be but meanly hot, and\nyou apply a medicine cold in the fourth\ndegree, it is true, you may soon remove that\ndistemper of heat, and bring another of\ncold twice as bad. Galen, de simp. med. facul.\nlib. 3. cap. 12.\nThen, secondly, Not only the distemper\nitself, but also the part of the body distempered\nmust be heeded; for if the head\nbe distempered by heat, and you give such\nmedicines as cool the heart or liver, you will\nbring another disease, and not cure the\nformer.\nThe degrees then of temperature are to\nbe diligently heeded, which antient physicians\nhave concluded to be four in the qualities,\nviz. heat and cold, of each we shall\nspeak a word or two severally.\nOf Medicines hot in the first degree.\nThose are said to be hot in the first degree,\nwhich induce a moderate and natural\nheat to the body, and to the parts thereof;\neither cold by nature, or cooled by accident,\nby which natural heat is cherished when\nweak, or restored when wanting.\nEffect 1.

The second effect is, the mitigation\nof pain arising from such a distemper,\nand indeed this effect hath other medicines,\nsome that are cold, and some that are hotter\nthan the first degree, they being rationally\napplied to the distemper.

Lastly, Medicines hot in the\nfirst degree, cherish heat in the internal\nparts, help concoction, breed good blood,\nand keep it good in temper, being bred.\nOf Medicines hot in the second degree.\nThese are something hotter than the\nnatural temper of a man.\nUse. Their use for such whose stomachs\nare filled with moisture, because their\nfaculty is too hot and dry; they take away\nobstructions or stoppings, open the pores\nof the skin, but not in the same manner\nthat such do as are hot in the first degree,\nfor they do it without force, by a gentle heat,\nconcocting, and expelling the humours, by\nstrengthening and helping nature in the\nwork; but these cut tough humours, and\nscatter them by their own force and power\nwhen nature cannot.\nOf Medicines hot in the third degree.\nThose which attain the third degree of\nheat, have the same faculties with those\nbefore mentioned; but as they are hotter,\nso are they more powerful in their operations,\nfor they are so powerful in heating\nand cutting, that if unadvisedly given they\ncause fevers. Use. Their use is to cut\ntough and compacted humours, to provoke\nsweat abundantly; hence it comes to pass\nthey all of them resist poison.\nOf Medicines hot in the fourth degree.\nThose medicines obtain the highest degree\nof heat, which are so hot that they burn the\nbody of a man, being outwardly applied to\nit, and cause inflammations, or raise blisters,\nas Crowfoot, Mustard-seed, Onions, &c.\nOf these more hereafter.\nOf cooling Medicines.\nPhysicians have also observed four degrees\nof coldness in medicines, which I shall\nbriefly treat of in order.[379]\nOf Medicines cold in the first degree.\nThose medicines which are least cold of\nall, obtain the first degree of coldness; and\nI beseech you take notice of this, that seeing\nour bodies are nourished by heat, and\nwe live by heat, therefore no cold medicines\nare friendly to the body, but what\ngood they do our bodies, they do it by removing\nan unnatural heat, or the body\nheated above its natural temper.\nThe giving then of cold medicines to a\nman in his natural temper, the season of\nthe year also being but moderately hot, extinguishes\nnatural heat in the body of man.\nYet have these a necessary use in them\ntoo, though not so frequent as hot medicines\nhave; and that may be the reason\nwhy an all wise God hath furnished us with\nfar more hot herbs and plants, &c. than\ncold.\nUse 1. Their use is first, in nourishment,\nthat so the heat of food may be qualified,\nand made for a weak stomach to digest.\nUse 2. Secondly, To restrain and assuage\nthe heat of the bowels, and to cool the\nblood in fevers.\nTherefore if the distemper of heat be but\ngentle, medicines cold in the first degree\nwill suffice; also children, and such people\nwhose stomachs are weak, are easily hurt\nby cold medicines.\nOf Medicines cold in the second and third degree.\nUse 1. Such whose stomachs are strong,\nand livers hot, may easily bear such medicines\nas are cold in the second degree, and\nin cases of extremity find much help by\nthem: as also by such as are cold in the\nthird degree, the extremity of the disease\nconsidered, for by both these the unbridled\nheat of choler is assuaged.\nUse 2. Also they are outwardly applied\nto hot swellings, due consideration being\nhad, that if the inflammation be not great,\nuse those that are less; if the inflammation\nbe vehement, make use of medicines cold\nin the second or third degree, always let\nthe remedy correspond to the just proportion\nof the affliction.\nUse 3. Thirdly, Sometimes the spirits\nare moved inordinately through heat, thence\nfollows immoderate watchings, if not deprivation\nof the senses, this also must be\nremedied with cold medicines, for cold\nstops the pores of the skin, makes the\nhumours thick, represses sweat, and keeps\nup the spirits from fainting.\nOf Medicines cold in the fourth degree.\nLastly, The use of medicines cold in the\nfourth degree, is, To mitigate desperate and\nvehement pains, stupifying the senses, when\nno other course can be taken to save life:\nof the use of which more hereafter.\nOf moistening Medicines.\nThere can be no such difference found\namongst moistening medicines, that they\nshould surpass the second degree. For seeing\nall medicines are either hot or cold,\nneither heat nor cold, seeing they are extremes,\ncan consist with moisture, for the\none dries it up, the other condensates it.\nUse. Phylosophers therefore call moisture\nand dryness, passive qualities, yet have\nthey their operation likewise; for moist\nmedicines lenify and make slippery, ease\nthe cough, and help the roughness of the\nthroat. These operations are proper to\nmedicines moist in the first degree.\nThose which are moister, take away\nnaturally strength, help the sharpness of\nhumours, make both blood and spirits\nthicker, looses the belly, and fits it for purgation.\nThe immoderate or indiscreet use of them\ndulls the body, and makes it unfit for action.\nOf drying Medicines.\nDrying medicines have contrary faculties\nto these, viz. To consume moisture, stop\nfluxes, and make such parts dry as are\nslippery, they make the body and members\nfirm, when they are weakened by too much[380]\nmoisture, that so they may perform their\nproper functions.\nYet although the members be strengthened\nby drying medicines, they have notwithstanding\ntheir own proper moisture in\nthem, which ought to be conserved, and not\ndestroyed, for without it they cannot consist:\nIf then this moisture be consumed by\nusing, or rather over use of drying medicines,\nthe members can neither be nourished,\nnor yet perform their proper actions.\nSuch medicines as are dry in the third\ndegree, being unadvisedly given, hinder\nthe parts of the body they are appropriated\nto, of their nourishment, and by that means\nbrings them into consumption.\nBesides, There is a certain moisture in\nthe body of man, which is called radical\nmoisture, which being taken away, the parts\nmust needs die, seeing natural heat and life\nalso consists in it, and this may be done by\ntoo frequent use of medicines dry in the\nfourth degree: And it may be this was the\nreason of Galen’s writing, that things dry\nin the fourth degree, must of necessity burn;\nwhich is an effect of heat, and not of dryness,\nunless by burning, Galen means consuming\nthe radical moisture.\nThe use then of drying medicines, is only\nto such bodies, and parts of the body, as\nabound with moisture, in which observe\nthese rules.\n1. If the moisture be not extreme, let not\nthe medicine be extremely drying.\n2. Let it be proper to the part of the\nbody afflicted, for if the liver be afflicted\nby moisture, and you go about to dry the\nbrain or heart, you may sooner kill than\ncure.\nThus have we briefly spoken of the first\nqualities of medicines, and in the general\nonly, and but briefly, because we shall\nalways touch upon them in the exposition\nof the other qualities, in which you must\nalways have an eye to these."

    "full_text": "CHAPTER XIV.\nOf purging Medicines.\nMuch jarring hath been amongst physicians\nabout purging medicines, namely,\nwhether they draw the humours to them by\na hidden quality, which in plain English is,\nthey know not how; or whether they perform\ntheir office by manifest quality, viz.\nby heat, dryness, coldness, or moisture:\nit is not my present scope to enter the lists\nof a dispute about the business, neither\nseem it such an hidden thing to me that\nevery like should draw its like, only to\nmake the matter as plain as I can, I sub-divide\nthis chapter into these following\nparts.\n1. Cautions concerning purging.\n2. Of the choice of purging medicines.\n3. Of the time of taking them.\n4. Of the correcting of them.\n5. Of the manner of purging.\nCautions concerning purging.\nIn this, first consider diligently, and be\nexceeding cautious in it too, what the matter\noffending is, what part of the body is afflicted\nby it, and which is the best way to\nbring it out.\nOnly here, by the way, first, have a care of\ngiving vomits, for they usually work more\nviolently, and afflict the body more than\npurges do, therefore are not fit for weak\nbodies; be sure the matter offending lie in[395]\nthe tunicle of the stomach, else is a vomit\ngiven in vain.\nVomits are more dangerous for women\nthan men, especially such as are either with\nchild, or subject to the fits of the mother.\nWhat medicine is appropriated to the\npurging of such a humour, for seeing the\noffending matter is not alike in all, the\npurging medicine ought not to be the same\nto all. I shall speak more of this anon.\nAs also of the divers ways whereby medicines\ndraw out or cast out humours, viz.\nby lenifying, cleansing, provoking nature\nto expulsion, and (which is stranger than\nthe doctor’s hidden quality) some purge by\nbinding, but indeed, and in truth, such as\nare properly called purging medicines,\nwhich, besides these faculties, have gotten\nanother, by which they draw or call out\nthe humours from the most remote parts of\nthe body, whether these do it by heat or by\nan hidden quality, physicians are scarce\nable to determine, it being very well known\nto modern physicians, though the ancients\ndenied it, that many cold medicines purge.\nThere is this faculty in all the purges of\nGalen’s model, (because he gives the whole\nsimple which must needs consist of divers\nqualities, because the creation is made up of\nand consists by an harmony of contraries)\nthere is (I say) this faculty in all purges of\nthat nature, that they contain in them a\nsubstance which is inimical both to the\nstomach and bowels, and some are of\nopinion this doth good, namely, provokes\nnature the more to expulsion; the reason\nmight be good if the foundation of it were\nso, for by this reason nature herself should\npurge, not the medicine, and a physician\nshould help nature in her business and not\nhinder her. But to forbear being critical,\nthis substance which I told you was inimical\nto the stomach, must be corrected in\nevery purge.\nCULPEPER’S LAST LEGACIES.\nSelect Medicinal Aphorisms and Receipts, for many diseases our frail\nnatures are incident to.\n1. A general Caution.\nLET such as love their heads or brains,\neither forbear such things as are obnoxious\nto the brain, as Garlick, Leeks, Onions,\nbeware of surfeiting and drunkenness.\n2. To purge the Head.\nThe head is purged by Gargarisms, of\nwhich Mustard, in my opinion, is excellent,\nand therefore a spoonful of Mustard\nput into the mouth, is excellent for one that\nis troubled with the lethargy: also the head\nis purged by sneezing; but be sure if you\nwould keep your brain clear, keep your\nstomach clean.\n3. For a rheum in the Head, and the Palsy.\nTake a red Onion, and bruise it well,\nand boil it in a little Verjuice, and put\nthereto a little clarified honey, and a great\nspoonful of good Mustard, when it is well\nboiled, raise the sick upright, and let him\nreceive the smell up his nose twice a day,\nwhilst it is very hot.\n4. For a rheum in the Head.\nBoil Pimpernel well in Wine, and drink[396]\na draught of the Wine in the evening, hot,\nbut in the morning cold.\n5. Another.\nStew Onions in a close pot, and bathe the\nhead and mouth, and nose therewith.\n6. For the falling off of the Hair.\nBeat Linseeds very well, and mix them\nwith Sallad-oil; and when you have well\nmixed them, anoint the head therewith, and\nin three or four times using it will help you.\n7. To purge the Head.\nChew the root of Pellitory of Spain, and\nchew it on both sides of thy mouth, and as\nthe rheum falls down into thy mouth, spit it\nout, but retain the root there still, till you\nthink the head is purged enough for that\ntime.\nFOR THE EYES, AND THEIR IMPEDIMENTS.\n8. For Eyes that are blasted.\nOnly wear a piece of black Sarcenet before\nthy eyes, and meddle with no medicine;\nonly forbear wine and strong drink.\n9. An excellent water to clear the Sight.\nTake of Fennel, Eyebright, Roses, white,\nCelandine, Vervain and Rue, of each a\nhandful, the liver of a Goat chopt small, infuse\nthem well in Eyebright-water, then distil\nthem in an alembic, and you shall have a\nwater will clear the sight beyond comparison.\n10. For a hurt in the Eye with a stroke.\nTake Agrimony, and bruise it very well,\nand temper it with white Wine, and the\nwhite of an egg: spread it pretty thick\nupon a cloth, like a plaster, and apply it\nto the outside of the eye-lid, and, although\nit be almost out, it will cure it.\n11. To draw rheum back from the Eyes.\nTake an egg and roast it hard, then pull\noff the shell, and slit it in two, and apply it\nhot to the nape of the neck, and thou shalt\nfind ease presently.\n12. For the web in the Eye.\nTake the gall of a hare, and clarified\nhoney, of each equal proportions: mix\nthem together, and lay it to the web.\nFOR THE EARS, AND THEIR IMPEDIMENTS.\n13. For pain in the Ears.\nDrop a little oil of sweet Almonds into\nthe ear, and it easeth the pain instantly:\n(and yet oil of bitter Almonds is our doctor’s\ncommon remedy.)\n14. For an imposthume in the Ear.\nBoil some milk, and put it into a stone\npot with a narrow mouth, and hold the sore\near over the pot whilst the milk is very hot,\nthat the vapour of the milk may ascend into\nthe ear: this is an often approved remedy\nto take away the pain, and break the imposthume.\nFOR THE NOSE, AND ITS INFIRMITIES.\n15. For Polypus; or a fleshy substance growing\nin the Nose.\nTake the juice of Ivy, and make a tent\nwith a little cotton, the which dip in the\njuice and put it up in the nostril.\n16. To cleanse the Nose.\nSnuff up the juice of red Beet-root; it\nwill cleanse not only the nose, but also the\nhead, this is a singular remedy for such as\nare troubled with hard congealed stuff in\ntheir nostrils.\n17. For bleeding at the Nose.\nBind the arms and legs as hard as you\ncan with a piece of tape-ribboning; that,\nperhaps, may call back the blood.\n18. For a Canker in the Nose.\nBoil strong ale till it be thick, if the Canker\nbe in the outside of the nose, spread it\nas a plaster, and apply it; if in the inside,\nmake a tent of a linen rag, and put it up\nthe nostril.\n19. Another for the Polypus.\nThe water of Adder’s-tongue snuffed up\nthe nose, is very good: but it were better, in\nmy opinion, to keep a rag continually\nmoistened with it in the nose.\n20. For bleeding at the Nose.\nTake Amber and bruise into gross powder,\nput it upon a chafing-dish of coals, and receive\nthe smoke up into the nose with a funnel.\n21. Another.\nWhen no other means will stop the[397]\nbleeding at the nose, it has been known\nthat it hath been stopped by opening a\nvein in the ear.\nOF THE MOUTH, AND ITS DISEASES.\n22. A Caution.\nWhosoever would keep their mouth, or\ntongue, or nose, or eyes, or ears, or teeth,\nfrom pain or infirmities, let them often use\nsneezing, and such gargarisms as they were\ninstructed in a preceding chapter; for, indeed,\nmost of the infirmities, if not all, which\ninfest those parts, proceed from rheum.\n23. For extreme heat of the Mouth.\nTake Rib-wort, and boil it in red Wine,\nand hold the decoction as warm in your\nmouth as you can endure it.\n24. For a Canker in the Mouth.\nWash the mouth often with Verjuice.\nOF THE TEETH, AND THEIR MEDICINES.\n25. A Caution.\nIf you will keep your teeth from rotting,\nor aching, wash your mouth continually every\nmorning with juice of Lemons, and afterwards\nrub your teeth either with a Sage-leaf,\nor else with a little Nutmeg in powder; also\nwash your mouth with a little fair water\nafter meats; for the only way to keep\nteeth sound, and free from pain, is to keep\nthem clean.\n26. To keep Teeth white.\nDip a little piece of white cloth in Vinegar\nof Quinces, and rub your gums with it,\nfor it is of a gallant binding quality, and\nnot only makes the teeth white, but also\nstrengthens the gums, fastens the teeth, and\nalso causeth a sweet breath.\n27. To fasten the Teeth.\nSeethe the roots of Vervain in old Wine,\nand wash your teeth often with them, and it\nwill fasten them.\n28. For the Tooth-ache.\nTake the inner rind of an Elder-tree, and\nbruise it, and put thereto a little Pepper, and\nmake it into balls, and hold them between\nthe teeth that ache.\nOF THE GUMS, AND THEIR INFIRMITIES.\n29. For a Scurvy in the gums.\nTake Cloves, and boil them in Rose-water,\nthen dry them, and beat them to\npowder, and rub the gums with the powder,\nand drink the decoction in the morning\nfasting an hour after it. Use red Rose-water,\nfor that is the best.\n30. For rotting and consuming of the gums.\nTake Sage-water, and wash your mouth\nwith it every morning, and afterwards rub\nyour mouth with a Sage-leaf.\nOF THE FACE, AND ITS INFIRMITIES.\n31. The cause.\nIt is palpable, that the cause of redness\nand breaking out of the face, is a venomous\nmatter, or filthy vapours ascending from\nthe stomach towards the head; where\nmeeting with a rheum or flegm thence descending,\nmix with it, and break out in\nthe face. Therefore let the first intention of\ncure be to cleanse the stomach.\n32. Caution negative.\nLet such as are troubled with red faces,\nabstain from salt meats, salt fish and herrings,\ndrinking of strong beer, strong waters\nor Wine, Garlick, Onions, and Mustard.\n33. For a face full of red pimples.\nDissolve Camphire in Vinegar, and mix\nit, and the Vinegar with Celandine-water,\nand wash the face with it: this cured a\nmaid in twenty days, that had been troubled\nwith the infirmity half so many years.\n34. To take away the marks of the small pox.\nTake the juice of Fennel, heat it lukewarm,\nand when the small Pox are well\nscabbed, anoint the face with it divers times\nin a day, three or four days together.\nOF THE THROAT, AND ITS INFIRMITIES.\n35. A caution.\nDiseases in the throat, most commonly\nproceed of rheum descending from the head\nupon the trachea arteria, or wind-pipe; in\nsuch cases there is many times no other\ncure than first to purge the body of flegm,\nand then the head of rheum, as you were\ntaught in the first chapter.\n[398]\n36. For hoarseness.\nTake of sugar so much as will fill a common\ntaster, then put so much rectified spirit\nof Wine to it as will just wet it, eat this up\nat night going to bed, use this three or four\ntimes together.\n37. Another.\nIf the body be feverish, use the former\nmedicine as before, only use Oil of sweet\nAlmonds, or for want of it, the best Salled-oil\ninstead of spirit of Wine.\n38. Another.\nTake Penny-royal, and seethe it in running\nwater, and drink a good draught of the\ndecoction at night going to bed, with a little\nsugar in it.\n39. For the Quinsey.\nTake notice that bleeding is good in all\ninflammations, therefore in this.\nIt were very convenient that a syrup, and\nan ointment of Orpine were always ready\nin the house for such occasions; for I know\nno better remedy for the Quinsey, than to\ndrink the one, and anoint the throat with the\nother.\nOF WOMEN’S BREASTS, THEIR INFIRMITIES\n",

To take away the marks of the small pox.\nTake the juice of Fennel, heat it lukewarm,\nand when the small Pox are well\nscabbed, anoint the face with it divers times\nin a day, three or four days together.\nOF THE THROAT, AND ITS INFIRMITIES.\n35. A caution.\nDiseases in the throat, most commonly\nproceed of rheum descending from the head\nupon the trachea arteria, or wind-pipe; in\nsuch cases there is many times no other\ncure than first to purge the body of flegm,\nand then the head of rheum, as you were\ntaught in the first chapter.\n[398]\n36. For hoarseness.\nTake of sugar so much as will fill a common\ntaster, then put so much rectified spirit\nof Wine to it as will just wet it, eat this up\nat night going to bed, use this three or four\ntimes together.\n37. Another.\nIf the body be feverish, use the former\nmedicine as before, only use Oil of sweet\nAlmonds, or for want of it, the best Salled-oil\ninstead of spirit of Wine.\n38. Another.\nTake Penny-royal, and seethe it in running\nwater, and drink a good draught of the\ndecoction at night going to bed, with a little\nsugar in it.\n39. For the Quinsey.\nTake notice that bleeding is good in all\ninflammations, therefore in this.\nIt were very convenient that a syrup, and\nan ointment of Orpine were always ready\nin the house for such occasions; for I know\nno better remedy for the Quinsey, than to\ndrink the one, and anoint the throat with the\nother.\nOF WOMEN’S BREASTS, THEIR INFIRMITIES"

Due to the age\nof the manuscript, most spelling and hyphenation variations were retained as\nprinted. For example, if the reader is looking for anniseed, search also\nfor annis-seed, aniseed and annis seed, etc. Changes made to the text\nare noted below. Only things that seemed to be clearly typos instead of\n1600s spelling variations were changed and noted below. For example,\ntext consistently uses “tertain” instead of “tertian.” Also watch for\nœ where one might expect æ and vice versa. “Bean” is often spelled as\n“Been.”\nOccasionally, items are out of alphabetical order. For example,\nMalahathram is located in the beginning of the F section. This\nwas retained as printed. At times, in long lists of names, certain plants\nare repeated and this was retained.\nMost but not all Latin terms are italicized. These were retained as printed.\nSome section titles were formatted in a certain way with a change made\nmid-section. Each was retained as printed. For example at the end of page\n283, the paragraph after the italic title that began with “Or” was laid\nout as all other paragraphs. Two pages later, the paragraphs beginning with\n“Or” were included with the italic centered title.\nAdditionally, there are a few instances of unmatched parentheses that were\nretained as printed for no clear location of the match could be ascertained.\nAn asterisk below indicates a blank or smudged place in the original type.\nPage 4, “tartian” changed to “tertian” (tertian or quartan agues)\nPage 10, “CARDEN” changed to “GARDEN” (GARDEN ARRACH)\nPage 11, “then” changed to “than” (drier than the stinging)\nPage 12, “yon” changed to “you” (from it, if you will)\nPage 16 et seq., the first word of a description such as under BARBERRY and BARLEY, “The” changed to “The” to match rest of book’s layout\n(The shrub is so) (The continual usefulness) and so on.\nPage 18, “helps” changed to “help” (help the mother, and kill)\nPage 19, “it” changed to “is” (that is to say, white, yellow)\nPage 20, “and” changed to “an” (being made into an oil)\nPage 20, “couses” changed to “causes” (long running causes)\nPage 22, “perishes” changed to “perish” (the stalks perish)\nPage 23, “Cesar” changed to “Cæsar” (of Octavius Cæsar)\nPage 29, “Scabions” changed to “Scabious” (those of Corn-Scabious)\nPage 29, “excellant” changed to “excellent” (excellent good to mollify)\nPage 30, “viens” changed to “veins” (of the veins which)\nPage 45, “speen” changed to “spleen” (liver, gall, and spleen,\nhelps)\nPage 45, “frickles” changed to “freckles” (away all freckles, spots)\nPage 45, “offorded” changed to “afforded” (is afforded room in)\nPage 45, “Chery” changed to “Cherry” (gum of the Cherry-tree)\nPage 45, “horseness” changed to “hoarseness” (cough, and hoarseness of)\nPage 46, “keep” changed to “kept” (strung up, are kept)\nPage 46, “as” changed to “has” (This has little or no)\nPage 49, “colours” changed to “colour” (brown colour, as big)\nPage 52, “It” changed to “It” to conform to majority of usage\nin this context (Place.] It grows in sundry)\nPage 52, “vain” changed to “vein” (any vein be swelled)\nPage 53, “Foals’s” changed to “Foal’s” (also Coughwort, Foal’s-foot)\nPage 56, “stays” changed to “stay” (stay fluxes of)\nPage 56, “think” changed to “thing” (without doing any thing)\nPage 56, “ounce” changed to “once” (Sun once a month)\nPage 56, word “and” removed from text.

Due to the age\nof the manuscript, most spelling and hyphenation variations were retained as\nprinted. For example, if the reader is looking for anniseed, search also\nfor annis-seed, aniseed and annis seed, etc. Changes made to the text\nare noted below. Only things that seemed to be clearly typos instead of\n1600s spelling variations were changed and noted below. For example,\ntext consistently uses “tertain” instead of “tertian.” Also watch for\nœ where one might expect æ and vice versa. “Bean” is often spelled as\n“Been.”\nOccasionally, items are out of alphabetical order. For example,\nMalahathram is located in the beginning of the F section. This\nwas retained as printed. At times, in long lists of names, certain plants\nare repeated and this was retained.\nMost but not all Latin terms are italicized. These were retained as printed.\nSome section titles were formatted in a certain way with a change made\nmid-section. Each was retained as printed. For example at the end of page\n283, the paragraph after the italic title that began with “Or” was laid\nout as all other paragraphs. Two pages later, the paragraphs beginning with\n“Or” were included with the italic centered title.\nAdditionally, there are a few instances of unmatched parentheses that were\nretained as printed for no clear location of the match could be ascertained.\nAn asterisk below indicates a blank or smudged place in the original type.\nPage 4, “tartian” changed to “tertian” (tertian or quartan agues)\nPage 10, “CARDEN” changed to “GARDEN” (GARDEN ARRACH)\nPage 11, “then” changed to “than” (drier than the stinging)\nPage 12, “yon” changed to “you” (from it, if you will)\nPage 16 et seq., the first word of a description such as under BARBERRY and BARLEY, “The” changed to “The” to match rest of book’s layout\n(The shrub is so) (The continual usefulness) and so on.\nPage 18, “helps” changed to “help” (help the mother, and kill)\nPage 19, “it” changed to “is” (that is to say, white, yellow)\nPage 20, “and” changed to “an” (being made into an oil)\nPage 20, “couses” changed to “causes” (long running causes)\nPage 22, “perishes” changed to “perish” (the stalks perish)\nPage 23, “Cesar” changed to “Cæsar” (of Octavius Cæsar)\nPage 29, “Scabions” changed to “Scabious” (those of Corn-Scabious)\nPage 29, “excellant” changed to “excellent” (excellent good to mollify)\nPage 30, “viens” changed to “veins” (of the veins which)\nPage 45, “speen” changed to “spleen” (liver, gall, and spleen,\nhelps)\nPage 45, “frickles” changed to “freckles” (away all freckles, spots)\nPage 45, “offorded” changed to “afforded” (is afforded room in)\nPage 45, “Chery” changed to “Cherry” (gum of the Cherry-tree)\nPage 45, “horseness” changed to “hoarseness” (cough, and hoarseness of)\nPage 46, “keep” changed to “kept” (strung up, are kept)\nPage 46, “as” changed to “has” (This has little or no)\nPage 49, “colours” changed to “colour” (brown colour, as big)\nPage 52, “It” changed to “It” to conform to majority of usage\nin this context (Place.] It grows in sundry)\nPage 52, “vain” changed to “vein” (any vein be swelled)\nPage 53, “Foals’s” changed to “Foal’s” (also Coughwort, Foal’s-foot)\nPage 56, “stays” changed to “stay” (stay fluxes of)\nPage 56, “think” changed to “thing” (without doing any thing)\nPage 56, “ounce” changed to “once” (Sun once a month)\nPage 56, word “and” removed from text.
